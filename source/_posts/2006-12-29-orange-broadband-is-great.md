title: 'Orange Broadband is great'

---

Well, I got Orange Broadband on the 27th after a surprising cutoff from PlusNet.
I didn't think I would be changed over till the 2nd and neither did Orange. But
I got the Live Box and a working connection after several phone-calls to Orange
Technical Support. I was a little disappointed in their support having had
conflicting statements about Apple Mac support and the accompanying cds and
manuals were all geared on XP / Wireless connections. After setting up the Live
Box though, I have been happy with the connection. 3.5Mb isn't that fast, but it
seems to have quickened browsing a bit, and I am awaiting on an OSX update to
test it properly.  God, how sad!

Also, I don't think the Live Box is unattractive, maybe odd, but it is OK. Just
await the free calls part to be activated.
