title: 'A walk around the chase'

---

Today's original plan was to do a Hathersage based walk, probably over Derwent Edge. However, having failed to get much sleep, partly due to the awful wind and rain last night, we decided to do a low level walk today. We have both been nursing colds, and 50mph cold winds in the face was never going to help.

So the revised plan was to drive to Cannock, and park near the Wolseley Centre. From here,  we walked north, in the chase. Along Spring Slade Road to the quarry, took us to Abraham's valley. From here, we walked along the main path over to Sherbrook Valley where we walked to Milford for lunch. We were hungry, and the hardest decision of the day was whether to have something from the chippy, or venture to the Wimpy for maybe a Big Bender! We decided to repeat Saturday's slap up battered sausage and chips extravaganza, by having yes,  battered sausage and chips! Still, at least its a change from the hot dogs tonight at the Overseal Bonfire.

Anyhow, after munching down lunch, we walked over the road to Tixall bridge where we joined the Trent and Canal. The 4 or 5 miles completed the walk back to the car, all in all about 12 miles, and 4 hours. Not the biggest walk ever, though my knees are certainly aching. Also my new Berghaus Twister did its job of keeping me warm, but not overly.

Tonight, we are off to the Bonfire at Overseal, drove past earlier at at least we are gaurenteed donots. Let's just hope a hotdog stand does arrive later ;)
