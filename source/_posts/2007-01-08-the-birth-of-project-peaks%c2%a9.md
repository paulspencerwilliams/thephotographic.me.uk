title: 'The birth of Project PeaksÂ©'

---

I was talking to my step brother Rob on Boxing Day who informed me that he was doing the <a href="http://www.ukoutdoorpursuits.co.uk/sub-4-peaks/4-peaks-main.htm">4 peaks challenge</a> whereby you walk up the highest peaks of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales (in alphabetical order) within 48 hours. He quized my experience on climbing the peaks and I was embarrased to say I had done none of these peaks and I am still a Munro Virgin. A few days later whilst thinking about this, I decided to rectify this and put some stakes down for this years ambitions. I would do the 3 peaks (missing Ireland - sorry) spring / early summer, definately.

<!--more--> The initial plan was and still is to do the 3 peaks in increasing elevation order with Scafell Pike on first weekend of April, Snowdon on first weekend of May and Ben Nevis June. That would minimise possibility of atrotious weather and give me some time to prepare. That was as far as I got until yesterday evening when I was talking to Chris Marsh. He was talking about this and that and mentioned 'Project Bike' - his streetfighter (sure you can provide a link Chris..) bike restoration project when the name hit me - Project Peaks. I mentioned it to Chris and the project was born. Chris is now interested in the project, maybe with his lovely wife Mel - a welcome addition they would be too!
