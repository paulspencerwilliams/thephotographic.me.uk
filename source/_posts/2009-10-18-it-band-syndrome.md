Hopefully will be walking soon... Went to osteopath and physio in Tamworth a couple of weeks ago. After hearing my summary of my knee history, he performed some diagnostic tests and my problem is...

IT band syndrome, aka runner's knee. Well, I will be annoyed if that has been the root cause for years as this is fairly simple to diagnose by physios and my previous physios did not pick this up. Therefore I might have gone through two arthroscopies for nothing. Well at least mr Bupa paid for them!!! Anyhows, I am icing the knee asbi type, and have been doing some massage. I have also got my second Physio appointment tomorrow evening and am (not) looking forward to some deep sports massage. Still, anything to get me back walking. My poor laser comp as only seen 4 nights use this year and i really want to try the kinder circuit during the Xmas break....
