title: 'The Malverns with the Sants'

---

Did the Malverns today with Phil Sant from work and his brother Paul. First time I had met Paul.

Got to North Malvern Rd Car Park 9ish then agreed to move to next car park (at foot of Worcester Beacon).Â  Transferred here to the Sant-mobile which took us down to Little Malvern.

Went up Hangman's Hill then British Camp before the ascent of the two biggies - Hereforeshire Beacon and Worcester Beacon. Decent hills and a moderately visible day though long range photos would not be possible.

Knee went again and the funny for the walk was Phil Sant's boot sole falling off. Emergency elastic band surgery failed and he resorted to carrier bag surgery encouraging a few funny looks from passers by. Got back to the car 2ish ready to munch a BLT, yum.

Got home about 3ish to buy chrimbo tree. Photos uploaded soon...
