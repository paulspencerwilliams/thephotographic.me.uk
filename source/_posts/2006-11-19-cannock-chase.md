title: 'Cannock Chase'

Attempted a 14  miler yesterday over Cannock. I thought some distance walking might help my knee, but it started to hurt after about 4 miles. This worries me as it is flat land, god knows how I will survive Malvern in December. I ended up doing about 10 miles but have recovered OK now. Can put full weight on left leg.

So now I might listen to the doctor and try some indoor exercises before next walk. Oh yeah, and warm up properly.

Once again, I didn't take any photos.
