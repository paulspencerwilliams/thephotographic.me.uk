title: 'First Project Peaks training walk'

---
To start the training for the Project Peaks walks (as Scafell Pike is only two
weeks away) Nick, Chris, Mel and myself went over to Church Stretton for a short
warm up walk. Got to Church Stretton at about 11.30 and walked the direct route
up to Caer Caradoc. Much chat and constant innuendos were exchanged on the
ascent - good news that weren't totally out of breath with the effort of
walking! Several photos were taken which I will try to obtain for this blog.

From the top we turned rightÂ  down towards Winstone Hill and right again down
the valley and back to Church Stretton. In all, it was a baby walk of around 5
miles with 300 metres ascent. Still a good starter and a brilliant introduction
to summer walking this year - the weather was great.
