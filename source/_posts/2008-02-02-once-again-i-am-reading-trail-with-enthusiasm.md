title: 'Once again, I am reading Trail with enthusiasm'

---

Since last summer, most of my posts have been about my knee, and my reacquaintance with mountain biking. This are linked, as I have been restricted to biking since my knee problems of last year. Well, light at the end of the tunnel appears blurry, but visible having gone through my second arthroscopy yesterday. The previous op was a failure allowing at mot 3 miles easy walking before pain prevented further progress.

Yesterday's post-op consultancy filled me with confidence. The 2nd opinion disproved further cartilage problems and the pain seems to come from gristly sinew stuck between the load bearing knee surfaces. This was easily cleaned out, and the prognosis is a return to walking in 6 weeks.

Its funny, I can track my confidence in returning to the hills by the interest shown in Trail and TGO magazines. Since taking out the last subscription in May, I have only skim read them, but last night in my morphine fueled frenzy, i cover to covered the March Trail edition. Going to get the Laser Comp out next week for an airing. Who knows, maybe an Easter return to the countryside even if I will be keeping the miles to a minimum. Going to scan the Explorers tonight for some easily accessible wild-camping spots.....
