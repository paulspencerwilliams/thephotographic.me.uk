Well, quite some time since I posted, mainly as I haven't had much time. Well, in order of events:

Went to the Lake District a few weeks ago with Phil from work, his brother and a mate. Great time, great food, and a great amount of mostly ale. Several new experiences - first frozen tent, first time in canoe (did length of Derwent Water and back), and first real end to end walk - from Grasmere to Keswick via Greenup Edge. Best news was the walk still wasn't enough to hurt my knee - really building up confidence in it now.

Also, I have done decent walks over the Peak District, and Shropshire. Last week, I did my first non Cannock Chase forest walk in the Wyre Forest. Tough day, humid and wet, but good. This weekend sees me walking probably in the Brecon Beacons or eastern Snowdonia depending on where the weather is best.

Next weekend is particularly exciting though, booked trained tickets for a 2 day walk and wildcamp in the Coniston / Langdale area. Not expected in Coniston until about 13:00 next Saturday, so planning an easy walk over the Old Man, then over Wrynose to camp and Three Tarns. Then a Sunday exploration of nearby Great End / Ill Crag / Scafell Pike, finally descending to Langdale, to bus back to Windermere - train out late afternoon.

Hopefully, normal regular posting service will resume...
