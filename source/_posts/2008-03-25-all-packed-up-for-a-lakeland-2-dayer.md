title: 'All packed up for a Lakeland 2 dayer'

---

Spent most of the day on the train today - had to go to london for final Knee consultation. The train had been delayed due to the freight derailment from Moor St, Birmingham. 5 hours on the train for a 5 minute consultation!! Anyhow, the consultation went well, a bit of leg twiggling and a question and answer session lead to the cunculsion that my knee is pretty much ok.

I need to continue my gradual exercise program, and what better way than the 2 days trip I had planned earlier to Grasmere. When I got back today, I spent 2 hours packing for Thursday's mtb ride around Loughrigg / Langdale, and what appears to be a walk over Helm Crag on Friday.

The bike ride will be fairly easy, done the distance on Thursday, albeit without as much ascent, or downhill.

However, before yesterdays Long Mynd walk (my first serious walk in 6 mon knarlyness ths or so), I assumed I couldn't do a proper Lakeland walk, so would probably play with the camera around some easily accessible waterfalls or similar. However, I am fairly confident now that I will be able to manage Helm Crag and maybe even over to Pavey Ark depending how I feel, and what the weather will bring.

The thoughts about a wild camp had been going through my mind until the recent snow and cold weather, combined with the forecast hail and thunder for Friday. I think lightening and carbon fibre poles get on a little too well!!

However, if I can tackle Friday's walk, then a wild camp could certainly be on the cards when I revist the Lakes on the 12th April.
