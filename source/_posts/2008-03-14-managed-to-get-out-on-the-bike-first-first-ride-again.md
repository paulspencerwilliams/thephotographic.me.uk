title: 'Managed to get out on the bike first first ride again'

---

Since my 2nd arthroscopy 6 weeks ago, I have been raring at the bit to 1) get out, into the hills, 2) get some exercise and 3) have some fun on the bike.

Tonight, I scored 2 out of 3 - a breathless blast on the bike around Cannock Chase. It was good to get out, they have improved the trail having added a couple of sections since my last ride. I only did one lap at about 7 miles, and had a sharp pain in knee about 1/3 of the way around, but it only lasted about 2 seconds. After that, the knee was fine.

Just as well, as I am going up to Grasmere for my first 2008 lake district excursion on the 27th / 28th and it won't be much fun stuck in the B&amp;B.

Might do my first walk for 6 months or so also, on Good Friday or Easter Monday. A couple of people from work might be up for a short-ish Midlands wonder. Think I might push for Caer Caradoc, been well over year since I have visited it.
