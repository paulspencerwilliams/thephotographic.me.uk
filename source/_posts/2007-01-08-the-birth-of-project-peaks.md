title: 'The birth of Project Peaks'

---
I was talking to my step brother Rob on Boxing Day who informed me that he was
doing the [4 peaks challenge](http://www.ukoutdoorpursuits.co.uk/sub-4-peaks/4-peaks-main.htm)
where you walk up the highest peaks of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales (in
alphabetical order) within 48 hours. He quizzed my experience on climbing the
peaks and I was embarrassed to say I had done none of them and I am still a Munro
Virgin. A few days later whilst thinking about this, I decided to rectify it and
put some stakes down for this year. I would do the 3 peaks (missing Ireland -
sorry) spring / early summer, definitely.

The initial plan was, and still is to attempt the peaks in order of increasing
elevation  with Scafell Pike on first weekend of April, Snowdon on first weekend
of May and Ben Nevis June. That would minimise possibility of atrocious weather
and give me some time to prepare. That was as far as I got until yesterday
evening when I was talking to Chris Marsh. He was talking about this and that
and mentioned 'Project Bike' - his streetfighter (sure you can provide a link
Chris..) bike restoration project when the name hit me - Project Peaks. I
mentioned it to Chris and the project was born. Chris is now interested in the
project, maybe with his  wife Mel - a welcome addition they would be too!
