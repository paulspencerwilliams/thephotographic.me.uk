I couldn't last another weekend without a walk so went over to Cannock Chase with Dazmo from work. Yesterday, I brought a tripod so my excuse for going to the Chase was to try the tripod in a panoramic stylee. So we started out by Milford and walked along Abraham's Valley then across the moorland to Sherbrook Valley. As we got there I tried the tripod for my first <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/282584134/in/set-72157594350357138/" title="my first panarama (a view over Sherbrook Valley - Cannock Chase)">panarama</a>, which I am fairly happy with.

Anyhow a few more pics latter, we complete the walk back over the stepping stones and towards car park. This was the first walk since my  previous Scarpa boot catastrophe and my ankle is still hurting a bit. Its also inflamed. However, I think I will be able to do a bit longer walker next week. Maybe even a hill!!!
