title: 'Dogging in the Chase'

---

Today, I rode the <a href="http://www.chasetrails.co.uk/">Follow The Dog</a> mountain bike trail at Cannock Chase for the first time. Great ride, and first purpose built XC trail I have tried and I love it. Brilliant twisty singletrack that go on forever, with fun bermed curves. The weather was great and the bike didn't get too dirty which is a bonus in November. Also reckied it for some night riding but think I will have to familiarize it more before trying under lights. Did about 10 miles in total and felt nothing from my knee :)
