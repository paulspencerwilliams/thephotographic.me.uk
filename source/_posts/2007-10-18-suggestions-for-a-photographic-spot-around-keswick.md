title: 'Suggestions for a photographic spot around Keswick'

---

I am camping at Keswick Saturday night, and am looking for some good photographic spots around there, or on the journey back south to Kendal. I can not walk far from the car (maybe  1-2 mile round trip) due to the knee issue, and really want to capture some great views - mind I suppose there aren't many bad views in the Lakes.

Any suggestions?
