title: 'Torn knee cartilage'

---

After 4 months of pain and minimal walking (partially due to NHS 24 also!!) I have finally plucked up courage to visit a knee surgeon regarding my knee. I went on Thursday to Little Aston Bupa Hospital, and after a short consultation, discovered I had torn my cartilage. Not a bad tear, but a tear non the less. This no doubt has caused the walking pains I have suffered, and the fix - an arthroscopy. Bupa never fails to impress - I could have had my first consultation on the evening I first made contact with Bupa, and I am now booked in for the operation next Saturday.

I believe (and hopefully am not too ambitious) that I will be back on the hills in a couple of months! May just see the last rays of October's sun before getting the Winter clothing out again. This discovery has obviously delayed project peaks and wildcamp until '08 now.
