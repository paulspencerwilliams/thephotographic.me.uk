title: '2009 Sant weekender!'

---

2 posts in 1 day - my blogging is like the buses.

Anyhow, just spent 2 hours packing for the 5 day trip up North with the Sants and Andy. However, Beta Sant (Phil!) has the shingles, and therefore has pulled out. Still, Paul and Andy will still be going up, and we plan to camp at Skyeside. 

Planned activities are to climb at Keswick Saturday, a Helvellyn or similar walk on Sunday and canoe on Ullswater Monday. I am sure we will try some 'beer' at the Brothers Water Inn. The plan was to return back Tuesday, but  a couple of weeks ago, I decided it would be rude to return so early, so booked a couple of days off work and a train ticket so guess what....

Another two day walk from Patterdale to Windermere Train Station via Helvelyn, Fairfield, Great Dodd then Rydal Hall. Probably will be camping by Grisedale Tarn, who knows!!

Most exciting news however, is the plan to get a new lightweight waterproof jacket. I am currently thinking about the Marmot Mica, but I am currently worried about the durability of such a jacket worn under a admittadly light rucksack. 

Here goes...
