title: '2nd attempt at Arenig Fawr'

---

Damn, GTD ain't working. Got to 11 days after my 2nd attempt at Arenig Fawr and Moel Llyfnant. I attempted this route from <a href="http://www.trailroutes.com/routes/default.asp">Trail</a> last year but retired due to a possible thunder storm approaching. I had managed Arenig Fawr but fell short of the 2nd mountain.

So here I go again. Got to Arenig Quarry about 08.30 but there were some dodgies in the car park opposite. As it was a v. quiet Saturday, I was a bit worried about leaving the car there so I parked it along Llyn Celyn at a National Trust car park.

Walked over the Afon Tryweryn and back to the quarry. Ascended a zig zag path to the base of some crags. I realised I had gone wrong on the previous attempt ended up on Y Castell. This time I also got it wrong but to a lesser degree. Crossing the marsh to the crags, I beared a little to right to take the crags nearly head on. It was a little vertical for my liking but I made it in one piece.

At the top of the crags, the fog came down and much compass work was needed to navigate to the drystone wall which handrailed me to the summit cairn / shelter. Its great to sit in the shade of the wind and strong rain. Decending the south west ridge was interesting with the great combination of wet rock AND wet grass AND steep decent. I went two foot sliding several times.

During the descent, a combination of rain and fog coupled with tired and blistering feet lead me to the solution of retiring back to the car. At the bottom of the drystone wall in the valley, I realised that the 'bridleway' that took my back to the main road was not visible in the heather covered bog. The bog was quite wet and I worried about another bog / thigh encounter so I took a bearing to the start of a farmers path at the edge of the valley. I made a beeline for this having to cross several (jumpable) streams and was relieved to find the path where I wanted it.

I followed the path back to the road, accross the Afon Tryweryn and back to the car. Its great to get the waterproofs off and sit in the car with the heater on ;) . Also, being a Saturday I missed the Sunday driver / A5 conflict making the 90 mile journey is less than 2 hours - nice.

In reflection, I made the correct choice to abandon the full trail however I was disssapointed to not be able to knock off one of my incomplete routes which currently stand at:
<ol>
	<li>Arenig Fawr  /  Moel Llyfnant</li>
	<li> Cadair Idris</li>
	<li>Full Edale skyline via my hell - aka Brown Knoll</li>
</ol>
