title: 'Knee problems again'

---
Went out today to see how my knee was. Was confident of little problems having
done a 12 mile bike ride last Sunday without problem. Also, I have been doing a
&gt;1 mile walk each day to the sandwich shop for lunch.

Today's agenda was a 3 miler around Sutton Park. A couple of small hills (only
about 50 metre height gain) and easy ground. It started well, but as I turned to
the home stretch, the knee pains started again. Exactly the same pain with
similar intensity to pre-op. It has been 6 weeks since operation, and I had my
last physio session so presumed this sorry episode was all over :(

Although I have 4 weeks to wait until final consultation, I will speak to Bupa
Monday to arrange an earlier consultation, get this thing sorted once and for
all. My main concern now, is whether it is only walking, or general activity
that can start the knee pain. Again, after the bike ride last weekend, can I
repeat a similar distance on Wednesday as I have the day booked of....
