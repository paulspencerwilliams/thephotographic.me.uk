title: 'A while since my last walk.'

---

Suppose I better confess. It has been over a month since my last decent walk.
Think that is the longest I have been over the last year. Why is this? Well
firstly, to say that work is hectic is an understatement. I have been working at
least 1 day per weekend over the last month, though this isn't so bad due to the
attrotious weather we have suffered recently.

Also, I have deliberately eased of the rambles to allow me knee to recover. This
has been a constant worry for project peaks and the other stuff I was so looking
forward to over the last couple of months. However, I can once again see light
at the end of the tunnel - work should be easing off over the next couple of
weeks, and I have 3 days of next week. I hope to spend much of this time in the
Peak District, though I will probably be infront of the dell at work :(

July is also the month I have to get fit ready for Project Wildcamp - my quest
to walk for a few days around the Lake District.

Only things that have really happened over the last few weeks are:

1) I brought some Inov-8 Mudrocs which I cristened over Cannock Chase and Sutton
Park. No hills yet, but plenty of wet feet. My current opinion of of them is
'jese, how could I wear those damn Scarpa SLs for so long!!'. At last, hopefully
some shoes that don't rub my ruddy ankles, and they are SO DAMN LIGHT.  2) Got a
promotion at work, that finally shifts my focus towards java work, moving away
from the evil that is MS$ 3) Brought a Mac Pro to replace my Imac G5. Any offers
gratefully received!!
