Well, it's been an interesting few weeks regarding two of my three main hobbies - walking and photography. MTBing is the other one of which I haven't done any since Christmas.

No, regarding walking, we have only done local walks of recent, even though we managed to get up to Keswick on my Birthday. However, whilst up there, I suffered a stomach upset so returned the very next day so no walks.

However, I have been putting much effort into photography, my interest being mainly driven by a new Nikon D90 given to me as a joint Birthday / Xmas pressie from the other half and my parents. Since getting the camera, I have been snapping anything and everything and my skills with the camera have come on leaps and bounds. I have spent several evenings recently re-keywording my Lightroom catalogue, and will be refining, tweaking and uploading pictures to Flickr. I am to complete the rest of my pictures by late January. Hopefully, by this time, the roads will be sufficiently clear of snow that my girlfriend will be happy to travel up to the Peak District for our first hill walk of the year.
