title: 'More news on knee'

---
Well, as some have noticed, there hasn't been much walking news on this site,
due solely to my knee problems. Well, to keep people up to date, I went for my
'final' consultation yesterday which I hoped would explain why, 4 months post
op, I still can't walk more than 2 miles without knee pain. It didn't with a
'wait another 3 months' and little more explanation.

Disappointedly, I resigned to maybe another year of no serious walking, but it
motivated me to finally speak to another consultant in London. His secretary
discussed my problem and was surprised the original consultant had not organised
an MRI scan, especially due to my longer than expected recovery.

I have therefore requested my medical notes to forward on, and will hopefully
make an appointment in the week before Christmas to hopefully get a 2nd opinion.
That, and the latest TGO article on waterfalls in the Lakes is spurring me on to
walking 2008.

Can't wait!!!!
