title: 'Derwent Edge with Phil ''The Rant'' Sant'

---

I don't know, I have been stood up by both my better (arguably) and my PM for a walk today in the peak district. However, the ever dependable Sant did make it for a spiffing walk over Dewent Edge in the Peak District.

Phil and I met at 10:30 at Ashopton. We got our boots and gaiters on, and started walking torwards Ladybower Inn. Here, turning left we ascended to Whinstone Lee Tor with little incident other than the Sant slipping and slidding several feet due to poor traction on the peat. All good fun, and no damage or dirty trousers!!

An hour or so later, and we got to the final Tor (Back Tor?) where we lunched. We then continued north to try and find the path down Howden Clough. The top bit was quite difficult to find, the path being quite feint. I nearly lost my right leg down a rabbit hole, then sant nearly lost his down another one!! Wreckoning on 0.5 points for a rabbit hole leg bite, Phil was now beating me 1.5 to nil on falls. <img src='http://paulspencerwilliams.me.uk/walkingwithwilliams/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_1937.jpg' alt='Me on Derwent Edge' style="height:300px;width:400px;float:right;" />

As we continued to try and find the path, the ground got tougher and tougher. Peat grough after peat grough after bog continued to try and get us to divert to a more established path. But no, we kept on trying to find the path, and find the path we did. I had mistakenly headed too far north and had missed the head of the trail. As we had walked south along the clough, we found the main trail.

Its a great trail, fairly easy walking, but with a bit of exposure on the right added a touch of excitment. The scenerie was beatiful, with brown peaty waterfalls cascading below. The clough took about 1 - 1.5 hours to descend, so we got back to the reservoirs about 2:30.

A simple walk along the waters edge completed the walk. The long road walk was considerably brightened up with conversation and an (un)healthy application of Harribo.

Finanly got to the car about 3:30 and had a hellish drive back down the M1; what with heavy rain and some more sleet.

Back home, I started looking at the 3 dayer I am planning in the lakes. The distance scares me, maybe 25 - 30 miles over 2.5 days of walking, but more than that, it is snowing. Don't get me wrong, I love snow. But a wildcamp is planned, and I don't think I am ready yet for camping in the -13 wind-chill as predicted for tomorrow. Still.... A couple of weeks to warm up the lakes!
