title: 'Another attempt at Edale Skyline'

---
This morning was an early one, out the house at 07:10 driving to Edale in the
Peak District. The plan was to try the Edale Skyline again and I nearly
succeeded.

I started off from the car park at about 09:00, initially up Grindesbrook Clough
and then up Golden Clough. First time up there, hard work but not as technical
as completing Grindesbrook. At Nether Tor at the top, the clouds had set in and
visibility was down to about 70metres. Turned right along the edge and continued
until Madwoman's Stones and Crookestone Knoll.

I then descended to Edale Cross and along approach to Win Hill before turning right
down towards Lose Hill. Crossing the railway track at the bottom I started the
ascent of Lose Hill. It seemed much easier that last time I did it, maybe my
fitness is improving!! At top of Lose Hill, I turned left along Hollins Cross,
Mam Tor then finally Rushup Edge.

At the end of Rushups Edge I had to decide whether to complete the skyline by
crossing Brown Knoll (where I went bog snorkeling a couple of weekends earlier)
or descend into the valley and reascend via Jacobs Ladder or Crowden Clough. I
chose the non-option - to descend and return to the car. I wasÂ  tired and there
wouldn't have been time for the cross valley walk and re-ascent / descent.

In the end I completed about 17 miles with about 900 metres ascent and again
failed to take any photos.
