title: 'Worries about Terra Nova Laser Comp'

---

As stated recently, I have brought a Terra Nova Laser Competition tent forming the shelter for Project Peaks. After listing to a recent backpackinglight.co.uk podcast about rucksacks, I decided to review how to pack my rucksack. I had tried last week to get my stuff into a Deuter 32 Futera unsuccessfully. The podcast suggesting separating the various parts of the tent / shelter across different parts of the 'sack.

Whilst reviewing the bits of the tent, I noticed one of the ends to a peg had come lose - remember I haven't had one (tent) erection yet! Em. not good. Whilst looking on the net, I found the pragmatic solution would be to superglue the ends onto the carbon fibre peg poles. However, should I really be resorting to superglue on my new 240 quid (RRP) toy? I think not.

I know Terra Nova produce some Titanium pegs for a the same RRP as the carbon fibre pegs I have. Therefore I think a straight swap or replacement guaranteed carbon pegs would be in order. I don't think tent pegs are the kind of things I can p**s around with as failure is more than a mere inconvenience.

I am eagerly awaiting Terra Nova's customer services reply.
