title: 'First full circuit of Church Stretton hills'

---
Did my first full circuit of the Church Stretton hills yesterday. Started at car
park to the north of The Lawley and walked over it. Strongest winds I have seen
here has me walking leaning 20 degrees into to to stop me blowing over. Down the
other side over fields to the base of Caer Caradoc. Climbed Little Cardoc and
then the main hill. Stopped near top in wind shade and had some lovely chicken
sandwiches... yum yum.. Post early lunch I went up Willston Hill then along
bridleway to right of Hope Bowder Hill. Through Hope Bowder and then over
Ragleth Hill brought me to the A49.

Crossing over into Little Stretton, I followed my favorite path up the Mynd -
Ashes Hollow. It was good fun as the steam was in full spate, and the normal 2
inch crossings turned into 1 foot crossings and all small scrambles were over
wet rock. At the top, I joined the Shropshire Way then along the open access
boundary past Jonathan's Rock to Plush Hill. Followingi the path past Inwood
House then Oakfield, I finally joined paths over farmers fields to the car park.

Overall 18.25 miles with about 1150 metres of ascent. Unfortunately my legs have
never ached so much so next week I really need to calm down a bit. Mind, it will
be my first Peak District yomp of the year.
