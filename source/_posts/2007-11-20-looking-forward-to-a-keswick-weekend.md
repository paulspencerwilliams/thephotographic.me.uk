title: 'Looking forward to a Keswick weekend'

---

Well, another couple of weeks have gone since posting so thought I better update...

Firstly, still loving the new bike. Definitely made the right choice for my kind of riding. Much faster and more responsive than the old Marin around smoother rides like Follow The Dog. Even keeping it immaculate washing straight after ride (though that might diminish after the first scratch..).

Haven't ridden or walked since Cannock last Wednesday mainly due to the weather. Its great, I was desperate for some decent snow last year, to learn some crampon use, but this year, no such antics are possible with the knee. So last thing I want is snow, as it isn't very mountain bike compatible, and this winter looks set to be cold.

The rest of this week entails:
1) Bike ride around Sutton Park tomorrow afternoon after hopefully getting my new HTC mobile phone / pda thingy.
2) Attending Project Managers leaving do on Thursday evening
k
3) Last and certainly not least, packing Thursday evening for a fun and scenery packed visit to Keswick and virgin ride around Derwent Water doing the 'Borrowdale Bash'. Standard outdoorsy Lake District fodder of driving up Friday evening, fun on Saturday, then maybe some photography Sunday morning before driving back. I have got to test my knee before final consultation on 4th Dec, so might do Catbells if the weather aint too bad.
