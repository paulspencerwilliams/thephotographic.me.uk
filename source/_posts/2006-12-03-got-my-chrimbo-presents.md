title: 'Got my chrimbo presents'

---

Went to Brum today with dad to buy Marilyn's birthday present, dad and Marilyn's
Christmas present and steer my dads chrimbo present choice in the right
direction.

Got mine quickly ;) by going into Snow and Rock. Got aÂ  Sigg water bottle, a
funky fleecy hat and best of all, some funky new Mountain Equipment Pinnacle
Gloves. They appear to be stupid warm and have separate inner and shell so can
customise heat / waterproofing as required. Just got to wait until Christmas
now, hope it doesn't snow beforehand!!
