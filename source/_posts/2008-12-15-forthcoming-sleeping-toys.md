title: 'Forthcoming sleeping toys'

---

Right, today, I took the bull by the horns and decided to advise my parents of the presents I deserved for Christmas and my forthcoming birthday. The first is a PHD Minimus sleeping bag, my first foray into down bags. Looking forward to replacing my Vango synthetic bag that ways 1.2kg, and the space saving in the rucksack will hopefully be sufficient to allow wild-camping with my 35l Deuter rucksack.

To accompany the bag, I have also asked (and ordered by proxy) a Therm-A-Rest Prolite 3 short mat which I plan to use in collaboration with a Z-Lite closed cell matt in winter conditions.

The net result will be saving of about 500gm in mild winter conditions, and from March / April, about a 2lb pack saving. The final weight based upgrades will be more optimized first aid kit (never used anything other than pain killers from this), lighter poles (only to be replaced when the length markers finally got wiped off mine), and sac itself. Oh for Xmas 09!!!!
