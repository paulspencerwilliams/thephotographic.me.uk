title: 'Great day over Edale'

---

Had a great day with my future sister and brother in law yesterday in the Edale Valley. Got up there in decent time and arrived in Edale around 11am. Unfortunately, this is a little late on a Sunday to get a parking space. However, we were lucky enough that as we left the car park, a dog walker had just arrived back at his car. Lucky!

Anyway, after  a quick change of footwear and application of gaiters, we started walking up Grindsbrook and beared right towards Ringing Roger. The pull up was steep, and hard work in the strong sun, but after 30 mins we got up to the top of Ringing Roger. From here, the gradient got less but it was quite hard walking up to the edges due to the snow on steep ground. We finally neared the trig point near Ringing Roger about 12 and walked west towards Grindsbrook Clough.

Finding the path was difficult, and we had a few moments putting feet into 2 foot deep soft snow holes,  but once the path was found, speed increased. We stopped around 1/2 way along the edge to some rocks which made an excellent place for lunch. It was now nearing 13:30 and the decision was to turn south over Grindslow Knoll, rather than continue the original plan of reaching the top of Jacob's Ladder before descending to Edale. Time was pushing on, and we were a little concerned about how icy Jacob's Ladder would be - it was bad a few weeks ago with far less snow on the ground. So the route was cut short a little mileage wise. Still 6 miles done - 2 or so through thick snow so the legs were worked quite hard!

A quick round of pints at the Old Nags Head Inn rounded off a great snowy and fantastically clear day. Next proper walk will be in a couple of weeks. Hopefully, the snow will have melted a little so we can up the mileage and ascent - I certainly need to as I have booked train tickets for March 31st to Windermere for a 2 night wildcamp and haven't done more than 10 miles in the last 3 or 4 months...
