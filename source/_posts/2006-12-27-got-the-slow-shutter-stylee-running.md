title: 'Got the slow shutter stylee running'

---

Went out on Boxing Day to test my knee again (it worked fine ;)) and try some
slow shutter / blurred water stylee. I therefore went over the Light Spout
Hollow on the Long Mynd and took a few shots that I've subsequently deleted from
flickr... Only a short walk (about 4 miles) but did come down Cardingmill Valley
deliberately quickly to put stress on knee and it survived admirably - think it
might finally be on the mend!
