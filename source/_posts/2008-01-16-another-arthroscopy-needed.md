title: 'Another arthroscopy needed'

---

Another month passes and another month without any hill walks. Infact since June all hill entertainment has been on two wheels rather than two feet. Anyhows, went to see another orthopedic surgeon yesterday, this time in London. After an MRI scan, and some manipulation of the knee / lower leg, he has suggested another arthroscopy to understand the root cause of my knee pain. He said my cartilage wasn't 'perfect' and some further trimming could be necessary.

It really is so frustrating having missed the winter walking. However, hopefully I might be back on the hills in March or April. In fact, I am going to book a weekend in Keswick for mid April so hopefully at least a wonder to the foot of Catbells.... Will have to make the most of the pre-op rides around Cannock and and a probably Peak District excursion on the 26th of Jan - Yeah!!!

Then, hopefully, full service will be restored ;)
