title: 'Wildcamp on high street'

---

I am in my tent ptiched just below loadpot hill on high street. It has been an amazing day that started in Troutbeck at 8. I had planned this walk last week, but to ensure it happened I decided not to post about it before.
I had been worried about the snow, didn't want to be another statistic and was wondering how doable high street would be. driving into ambleside yesterday didn't help, conistom old man looked covered in the White stuff from about 700 metres.  I had a low level route planes as a backup but didn't relish a walk off the mountains when I had driven so far.
Anyhow, after camping at Rydal hall, which was nice, I left the airs foe troutbeck. The walk, nor the initial walked helped my worries, low cloud covered the hills from 500 metres, god knows would behind that. As I continued up the valley, the only snow saw was little puddles here and there, and more serious stuff in the gullies. However, it came thicker and more common as I ascended until I neared Yoke when the mist obscured evering for about 20 metres. Great, it would keep me guessings.

When I finally arrived at thorntwaite drag beacon, the mist initially lifted just enough to see a large cornice hanging off high street and just as I decided I might escape via stony cove, the mist lifted again to reveal a totally doable and beutiful scene. Lots of easy, safe snow away from the edges, which could be avoided anyhow. Loads of photos later accompanied by a smile for about 2 miles I was in walkers bliss. The scenery is as good as I have seen it up here, I think I prefer it to heavily covered peaks.

Fast progress was made to High Raise where I startedto slow down, feeling tired and hungry. A breakfast bar and banana sorted me out till I arrived at my designated camp, just north of loadpog hill. I got here about 4:30 and pitched the tent as soon as I found a half decent place. It is windy but hopefully I have enough cover so the tent stays up till about 4:30 when I plan to get up and start the return trip at lower level along haweswater. Here's hoping I see the eagle!

Right, a bit of planning to do then sleep by 7, I can already see it going quite dark.
