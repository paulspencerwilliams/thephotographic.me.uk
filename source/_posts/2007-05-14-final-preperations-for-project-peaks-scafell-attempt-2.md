title: 'Final preperations for Project Peaks Scafell attempt 2.'

---

After the previous attempt, I have rallied the troups and refined the plans for the 2nd attempt on Scafell Pike (I know, I know, not quite the Eiger). Unfortunately it appears two of the original troups might not be able to attend so it falls on Phil and myself. We have walked together a few times and I have little doubt that we will make it this time. However, I am in doubt that I will be able to walk again after it - general erosion of the feet is assured by the 15 mile / 1670 metre ascent route (yeah thats 1.7 Scafell Pikes).Â  This was brought about the by equally stupid ideas:
<ul>
	<li>to walk from the campsite at the other end of Wastwater which is 3 miles long!</li>
	<li>to do both Scafell Pike and Scafell and the further re-ascent needed to gain Illgill Head overlooking Wastwater.</li>
</ul>
Still, if you are going to do the highest mountain in England, you might as well do it right, and whats more traditional than in the driving rain forecast.

The rest of the plan is roughly, drive quicly from work to Lake District and hopefully traverse the Wrynose / Hardknott pass road to Nether Wasdale by about 8pm (did I mention I was optimistic). This will allow for a sunlit erection of the tents and maybe a pint or 3 in the Screes Inn.

Saturday, we cook, walk, sleep.

Sunday, I hopefully have my way and go to Winwood Outdoors to try some lightweight backpacks. However it's Keswick Mountain Festival time I think so I am not looking forward to the crowds. Sunday afternoon, time to drive home me thinks.
