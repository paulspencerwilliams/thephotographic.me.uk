title: 'Final preperations for Project Peaks Scafell attempt 2.'

---
After the previous attempt, I have rallied the troups and refined the plans for
the 2nd attempt on Scafell Pike (I know, I know, not quite the Eiger).
Unfortunately it appears two of the original troups might not be able to attend
so it falls on Phil and myself. We have walked together a few times and I have
little doubt that we will make it this time. However, I am in doubt that I will
be able to walk again after it - general erosion of the feet is assured by the
15 mile / 1670 metre ascent route (yeah thats 1.7 Scafell Pikes).Â This was
brought about the by equally stupid ideas;to walk from the campsite at the other
end of Wastwater which is 3 miles long, to do both Scafell Pike and Scafell, and
the further re-ascent needed to gain Illgill Head overlooking Wastwater. Still,
if you are going to do the highest mountain in England, you might as well do it
right.

The rest of the plan is to drive quicly from Lichfield to the Lake District and
hopefully traverse the Wrynose / Hardknott pass road to Nether Wasdale by about
8pm (did I mention I was optimistic?). This will allow for a sunlit erection of
the tents and maybe a pint or 3 in the Screes Inn.

Saturday, we cook, walk, sleep.

Sunday, I will hopefully get my way and go to Winwood Outdoors to try some
lightweight backpacks. However it's Keswick Mountain Festival time I think so I
am not looking forward to the crowds. Sunday afternoon, time to drive home me
thinks.
