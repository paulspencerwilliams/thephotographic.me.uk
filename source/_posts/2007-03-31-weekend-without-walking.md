title: 'Weekend without walking :('

---
Not going out as last weekend I went to Wales (Hay Bluff / Lord Hereford's Knob)
and promptly knackered my ankle then my knee. This time my right knee feels how
my left knee felt over Christmas. This isn't good as I only have 3 weeks to mend
myself before start of Project Peaks. Trying to sort physio over next couple of
days and might hold back on walking next weekend too - not good as it is Easter.
At least my new Paramo Fuera is GREAT.
