title: 'Antisocial behaviour progress?'

---

I received a reply to the email I sent yesterday to the Walsall Council Anti-Social Behaviour Coordinator and Neighbourhood Policing department within the Walsall Police Service. My email questioned the authorities on what was being planned to curb the antisocial behaviour on our estate.I expected no response for a week or so and was suprised this afternoon when I got home to see a response from a Council representative. The response suggested that the council would speak to the police regarding the issue and sent some forms to print off and file in for each antisocial behaviour incident I saw. So I have printed these and will distribute around the neighbourhood and fill in as appropriate.
