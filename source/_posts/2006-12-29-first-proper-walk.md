title: 'First proper walk'

---

Right, yesterday was my Birthday and as a present to myself, I decided to go for
my first proper walk since all my knee and ankle trouble. So I went back up to
the Hope Valley and repeated a  walk around Ladybower Reservoir from earlier in
the year. 

Starting from the A57 Snake Rd by the Ladybower Inn, I walked up past Ashopton,
Winstone Lee Tor, the Wheelstones, White Tor, Salt Cellar and up to Lost Lad. I
then dropped back down to Ladybower and walked along the eastern bank to the
car. All in all, a good 7 or 8 miler. Not massive, nor great amount of ascent
but I felt nothing from my knee other than when I was walking around Hathersage
buying some clothes. My ankle was ok too and my physio has now provided  (freely
- as in beer!!) more adhesive foam to protect my outer ankle bone, good job as I
  couldn't find them for love nor money - I am now officially loving the Scarpa
SL2s.

No photos today, as I tried some funky panorama stuff but forgot the spirit
level for the camera and they all came out rubbish.
