title: 'First proper walk'

---

Righty, yesterday was my Birthday and as a present to myself, I decided to go for my first proper walk since all the knee / ankle trouble. So I went back upto the Hope Valley and repeated a Ladybower walk from earlier in the year. Starting from the A57 Snake Rd by Ladybower Inn, I walked up past Ashopton, Winstone Lee Tor, the Wheelstones, White Tor, Salt Cellar and upto Lost Lad. I then dropped back down to Ladybower and walked along the eastern bank to the car. There you go, a good 7 or 8 miler. Not massive, not great ascent but I felt nothing from my knee other than when I was walking around Hathersage buying some clothes. My ankle was ok too and my physio has now provided  (freely - as in beer!!) more adhesive foam to protect my outer ankle bone, good job as I couldn't find them for love nor money - I am now officially Loving the ScarpasÂ©.

No photos today, as I tried some funky panarama stuff but forgot the spirit level for the camera and they all came out rubish.
