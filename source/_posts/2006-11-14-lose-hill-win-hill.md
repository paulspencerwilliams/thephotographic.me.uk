title: 'Lose Hill / Win Hill'

---

Was tired in the morning as we have been working hard on NHS 24 project all week
and 6.15am is no time to wake on a Sunday morning. Anyhow, I picked up Phil
8ish and started walking from Hope at 9.30.I was eager to get my first full GPS
route working but the GPS refused to pick up satellites until about  3/4 the way
up Lose Hill. Got to the top and Phil was impressed with the views of the Edale
valley. We then back-tracked back down the hill and across countryside to begin
the ascent of the larger Win Hill. The GPS proved to be convenient with only a
couple of peaks required at the map. We rushed up to the plateau and into shelter
before Win Hill Pike so that we could eat without getting drenched by the
forthcoming rain. Luckily this didnt materialise, instead we were accompanied by
slight dampness up to to the top of Win Hill Pike.

Good  views over Ladybower Reservoir and Stanage Edge in the distance made the
walk worthwhile. The descent brought on further knee pain though. Not enough  to
stop me walking  but enough to force poles and a slow down.

Best bit was probably getting back to the car  @ 2.30pm just in time for a
heavier rain shower. I love driving in the rain watching people outside getting
wet - especially the unlucky <strike>sods</strike> walkers we saw on the way
back leaving the A53 presumably on the way to Flash Youth Hostel. The rain was
heavy and I am not convinced they would get their by sunset.

No photosets for this walk.
