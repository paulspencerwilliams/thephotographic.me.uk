title: 'Lose Hill / Win Hill'

---

Was tired in the morning as we have been working hard on NHS 24 project all week and 6.15am is no time to wake on a Sunday morning. Anyhows, I picked up Phil 8ish and started walking from Hope at 9.30.I was eager to get my first full GPS route working but the GPS refused to pick up satellites until about  3/4 the way up Lose Hill. Got to the top and Phil was impressed with the views of the Edale valley. We then back-tracked back down the hill and accross countryside to begin the ascent of the larger Win Hill. The GPS proved to be convenient with only a couple of peaks required at the map. We rushed upto the plateau and into shelter before Win Hill Pike so that we could eat without getting drenched by the forthcoming rain. Luckily this didnt materialise, instead we were accompanied by slight dampness upto to the top of Win Hill Pike.

Good  views over Ladybower Resevoir and Stannage Edge in the distance made the walk worthwhile. The descent brought on further knee pain though. Not enough  to stop me walking  but enough to force poles and a slow down.

Best bit was probably getting back to the car  @ 2.30pm just intime for a heavier rain shower. I love driving in the rain watching people outside getting wet - especially the unlucky <strike>sods</strike> walkers we saw on the way back leaving the A53 presumably on the way to Flash Youth Hostel. The rain was heavy and I am not convinced they would get their by sunset.

No photosets for this walk.
