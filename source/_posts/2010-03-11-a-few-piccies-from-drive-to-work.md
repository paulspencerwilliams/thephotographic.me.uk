title: 'A few piccies from drive to work'

---

On the drive to work earlier this week, I noticed the great early morning light falling on the church in Lullington - a village I drive through. This morning, I noticed snow drops starting to appear. I often carry my camera in the car boot, so I decided to park up, get the camera out and rattle off a hundred snaps or so.

I have enjoyed some architectural photography recently, but I was disappointed at this mornings attempts with the church. I struggled to get far enough away to get the church in context and the pics came out a little shallow. I also failed to capture the great light, but maybe next time.... Also, the sky was perfect blue - a little bland so I will try shooting again with an interesting cloud backdrop.

Instead, I had a play with some flower shots and quite liked the results for the small amount of time invested. I am now getting to grips with depth of field, and in particular how I could get bokeh effects at smaller apertures than I originally thought.

Anyhow, an enjoyable drive to work, and was a little disappointed that on the drive home, I saw a buzzard sitting on a fence next to the road. I would have stopped to get some pictures at close range, but the road had no parking cones due to the Basra Memorial Wall opening at the National Memorial Arboretum.
