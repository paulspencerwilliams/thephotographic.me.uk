title: 'Project wildcamp is a go.....'

---
I have been finalising my kit list and purchasing to allow Project Wildcamp to
start. A decent backpack is my last purchase, and this was unexpected - I was
maybe a little optimistic to think my lightweight kit would fit in my 32l
Deuter 32 Futura. This Friday is the day of reckoning, where I will test the
tent, stove and sleeping bag and judging by the previous few days, a baptism of
fire (well rain / mud) is looking likely.

In parallel to planning Project Peaks, I have started to devote time to planning
at least one full length walk of the Peak District and possibly a a solo
crossing the Shropshire hills before letting the tent loose in the Lakes.
