title: 'Further update to antisocial behaviour issues.'

---

Well, tonight is the night before my first court case (as a witness I hasten to
add). And since the last post, quite a bit has happened. Firstly, I have
received more letters from the council thanking me for reporting the issues last
week. Also I have made a meeting appointment for next Thursday again with the
council to discuss matters. It looks like they are seriously interested in the
problems on Park Hall.

Finally, I also heard back from the Police who wish me to contact them on the
weekend. Maybe they are interested too.
