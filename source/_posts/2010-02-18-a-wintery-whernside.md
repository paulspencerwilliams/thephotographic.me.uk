title: 'A wintery Whernside'

---

Well, after a few months constrained really to local walks, the last couple of weeks have been great. Two weeks ago, we managed a walk over Church Stretton, and last Saturday we did Rushup Edge, Brown Knowl (easiest crossing I have ever had due to the icy peat) and descended Jacob's Ladder.

This Wednesday, I decided to take the day off from work and try something a little more serious. My original idea was to try my crampons for the first time by ascending one of the snowdonia peaks, but MWIS suggested something else by virtue of heavy snow, hail and thunder. I therefore looked to other mountainous regions and decided upon attempting Whernside and Ingleborough.

I left the house about 6am, and got upto Ingleton about 9:15 to buy the requisite OS map, having planned the route online. Finally arrived at Ribblehead about 9:45 and whilst packing my rucksack, I got chatting to a friendly local in the car park. As we discussed routes, we started walking together up the east flank of Whernside.

The conversation was interesting, local knowledge adds so much to these walks, I learnt about the effort on redirecting the river down Dentdale, about the shake holes, and the limestone pavements on the foot of Ingleborough. Now, I had orignally intended to finish the chat half walk up the hill, and resume normal solitary walking with my camera. However, time flew as our conversation covered the armed services, politics, and the virtues of vegetarianism (I have given up meat for lent...). Next thing I know, we are crossing an icy tarn before topping out on the summit. I was surprised to see the 6 foot or so of snow built up against the wall, and the cornice build up.

Once at the summit, I enjoyed an M &amp; S ploughmans sandwich and three bean / cheese wrap before resuming the walk down a decidely rocky artifical stair case. I was a little worried with the ice covered steps, and hoped the gradient wouldn't be too much for me knee. But no, I was fine, and felt quite fresh by the time I reached the road.

However, time was not on my side for an ascent of the planned Ingleborough. It was about 14:30 and my walking colleage said it would take a good 3 hours to complete the second hill. This time constraint, combined with the no doubt icy north face descent Â led me to the descision to walk over the limestone pavements at the foot of Ingleborought which led to a faint path over fields back to Ribbledale.

All in all, about 12 miles of walking over 6 hours, followed by an awful 3.5 hour drive down the M6. Still, a fantastic winter walking day, as the photos hopefully show...
