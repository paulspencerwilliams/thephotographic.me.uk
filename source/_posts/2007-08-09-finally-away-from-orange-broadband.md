title: 'Finally away from Orange Broadband'

---

After a mammoth 2 or 3 weeks of calls to technical and customer support, I have finally got a MAC code from Orange and am transferring to Waitrose broadband. I know, I know, a bit wusy, and only 5gb transfer a month, but I am not a bit-torrrenter and their techy support etc is meant to be v. good. I have come to realize that reliability and customer support is actually very important when I am on call for our IT system. A reliable internet connection is what stands between a simple dial in / reboot a server or whatever from a 1 hour round trip to Lichfield to do the same from offices!

I also like the fact that they donate proceeds to charity.

Oh, and 'big up da' http://www.orangeproblems.co.uk as they say in Staines.
