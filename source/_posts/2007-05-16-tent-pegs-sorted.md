title: 'Tent pegs? Sorted!!'

---

Spoke to [Terra Nova](http://www.terra-nova.co.uk) and 
[The Outdoor Shop](http://www.theoutdoorshop.com) today to sort out knackered
carbon fibre tent pegs.

Terra Nova wouldn't move from their default 'we can replace like with like or
offer a downgrade to aluminium pegs' - not good.  Luckily The Outdoor Shop was a
little more sympathetic. They hadn't heard of other stories of these problems
but agreed in principle in replacing the pegs with like for like - including
same price replacement. As the only good lightweight skewers offered by Terra
Nova were the Titanium Skewers, they offered me these provided I pay the
difference - normally nothing, but their discount price means I have to pay
Â£6.02. I am not too peeved but think they could have offered them for nothing.

Still, hopefully next I should be the proud owner of some more titanium to go
with my MSR cutlery set. Oh yeah, and I go to the lakes in only, er, 45 hours or
so:)
