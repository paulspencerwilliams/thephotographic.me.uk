Well, after a month of osteopathy, my physician has mandated a decent hill walk to test the knee. Oh it's a hard life. Well, tomorrow is the day, and Hope Valley is the destination. A quick walk up from Hope to Winhill Pike, some photos over Derwent Water and then back down the river Noe. Hopefully the knee won't let me down. Just got to decide whether to wear my old SLs or trainers.. Wore the boots tonight to the Conkers firework display and they feel HEAVY!!!!
