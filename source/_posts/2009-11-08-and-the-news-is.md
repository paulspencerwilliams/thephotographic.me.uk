The knee works! yah!! Well, I say works as i survived a 10 miler derwent edge circuit today. However, my feet didn't. After using trail shoes solely this year from about February, with the recent wet weather and boggy ground on the edge, I knew it was a gamble to try them over my boots and gaiters. But I tried, and to be honest, my feet weren't too cold, I had thick smartwool socks and the temperatue was about 5 - 6 degrees in the valley.

However, by the end of the walk, my feet ached a little more than from the mileage alown, so next week, I will be trying the scarpa sls again.
