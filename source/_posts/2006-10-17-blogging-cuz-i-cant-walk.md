title: 'blogging cuz I canâ€™t walk'

---

Its a Tuesday, and I am on holiday for the week. That means I should have been
in Wales, Shropshire or the Peak District today. But I am not. I have been
nerding at home for the longest period during the last couple of years.

The reason for this is that I have hurt my ankle. How? I brought some new walking
boots a couple of weeks ago and listened carefully to the guy who fitted and
sold me the new [Scarpa SLs](http://www.scarpa.co.uk/hill/sl.html). He told me
that the boots would need wearing in, so start of with a short walk (well
actually first two weeks in the home) and build up to decent lengths over a few
weeks. Only a fool would start out with a 15 + mile walk.

So off I went with the virgin boots, for a 16 miles yomp around Shropshire from
Long Mynd to the Stiperstones. Jeez, I must be tuff, feet are fine.  So a couple
of days later I went for a more sensible 8 miler around [Waun
Fach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waun_Fach). Don't know what changed but about
a mile below the summit, my outer right ankle started rubbing and hurting. I
made the summit and got down having changed socks, applied plasters etc etc but
still the ankle hurt. 10 days later and I am still unable to wear a pair of
boots without pain.  And I am now in the middle of a weeks holiday originally
destined for a few day Lakeland wonder.

So instead, I have created this, my first real attempt at a blog to record my
forthcoming peak bagging attempts and software development capers.
