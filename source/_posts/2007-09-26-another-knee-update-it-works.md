title: 'Another knee update - it works !!'

---
Well, after Saturday's sorry episode, I have brought forward my final
consultation with the knee surgeon. It's tomorrow - fingers crossed its
something easy to fix. Think i will be pushing for mri scan this time!!

A while ago, I had decided to book every wednesday from beginning of October
till Christmas off, so I could do two walks a week - Wednesday and a weekend
day. Obviously, as I havn't been walking but it seemed I could cycle, I thought
I would go out today for an easy cycle - just to Sutton Park. The intention was
to test the knee to make sure it worked on the bike, and this could be useful
news for the surgeon.

So I did, and the knee did work. I cycled to the park - about 6 miles round
trip, with a lap of around 7 miles. All the time, I was waiting for the
discomfort, but it just didn't come. Even up and over Barr Beacon, I managed to
keep in decent gear with no pain. This afternoon, I cleaned the bike and visited
Leisure Lakes in Wolves to buy some clothes, and even then, I only suffered
slight muscle aches as normal after exercise.

So its baffling, the knee can't handle a 1.5 mile walk, but 13 mile bike ride is
fine - Go figure.
