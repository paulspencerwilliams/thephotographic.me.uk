title: 'Wet and windy over Caer Caradoc'

---

Went for another Shropshire walk yesterday. Was initially going to just go over Caer Caradoc but as I reached the top I decided I would carry on over the Lawler. After all, I was feeling fine and energetic, the weather was OK contrary to the forecast and I had loads of time. So off I went down over Little Caradoc.

The weather held up fine as I started to climb the Lawler but deteriorated very quickly. I was worried as it started hailing and I wondered the possibility of the often accompanying thunder. Not a bad worry considering <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6221167.stm">this</a>. However, the worry fuelled adrenaline in atrocious weather made me feel like a true mountaineer, alone conquering unknown mountains far a field. This illusion was only shattered by occasional walkers on their way down.... Wind was very strong blowing my poles and myself all over the place and it didn't get any better until I started to descend the other side.

It has been a while since I have done the Lawler and with the northern section out of sight in my map case, I underestimated the time it would take to get off the hill on the other side. Initially I worried about not being back home by 15:00 but worry increased lower down as I realised I only had till 14:00 on the car park ticket. It was now 13:00 and I had about 3 miles to cover. 3 miles on slippy, wet mud on a track I didn't know and as I found out later, went up hill! Right, I was on a mission. Not going to let car park Nazis charge me for under payment. I even ran a bit, though Scarpa 3/4 season boots are a little heavier / less flexible than my running shoes. Finally got to Church Stretton at 14:30. I was relieved to get to the car and see no penalty notice under the windscreen wiper. 1 - 0  to me ;)

Overall, dispite the weather, I had a really good day that persisted until I hit the M6 motorway. Damn Ikea sales coupled with heavy rain caused congestion and a 40mph speed limit :( Took 1 hour 40 minutes to the return 50 mile journey, I record for me I think.

No photos, as exposing (no pun intended) the camera to the heavy rail would no doubt knacker it.
