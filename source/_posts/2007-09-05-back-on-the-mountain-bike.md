title: 'Back on the mountain bike'

---

In my last session, my physio advised me to do some work on an exercise bike or real bike to build my leg muscles up without impact. I haven't been on my bike for about 2 years, having been a keen mountain biker up until University days.

So I got the turbo trainer out last Sunday, and had a quick spin. Jeez, this trainer is loud. Well, thats what I though until I realised it was the knobbly tires. All I need to do is get some mtb slicks. Went to Leisure Lakes in Wolverhampton, who could only provide 1.2 inch (real thin!) slicks which I bought at Â£22.50 - ouch.

However, something happened in store that I was not expecting.... I fell in love with bikes again. Now maybe I am just shallow and materialistic, but I mean, come on!!! Loads of bikes, gleaming, metallic, em.. anodised aluminium. I was impressed with my strength to not just buy one there and then. However, I didn't and whilst driving back home, fitting the new slick, and setting up the trainer, I was thinking about riding the old bike for real.

The final decision to start biking again occurred about 3.5 nanoseconds after I realised the slick tire / trainer combo wouldn't work, and I would have to go out on the bike properly to do any leg work.

I spent much of Sunday and Monday thinking more about going out onto the hills and the walking / cycling choice. I have the following concerns:

1) Which pursuit is going to be best for my knee? Yeah, cycling can be bad, especially with clipped pedals, but there is little / no impact - well apart from unexpected face / tree impacts. Suppose, here the answer is there is NO choice. I do not have to choose either as I can choose BOTH.

2) Will my bike be a good enough platform to run for the next year or so? It was a real good bike 10 years ago, but time has moved on, it still has V-Brakes, and the front and rear shocks are getting tired and sloppy. I have already been told spare parts for the fork are no longer available. A new drivetrain will probably be necessary also.

3) Which pursuit is best for my hill ambitions. I want to see a lot of more of the Lakes, Wales and Scotland. You certainly see more (in terms of quantity) on a bike due to extra speed. However, access to many fells, Munros etc are by foot only. I also hate fuss and clutter in leisure time, and hate the prospect of driving up-to the lakes with both walking gear and biking gear filling the car. Having to truly secure the bike, toolbox etc when out walking and such like.

4) Cost. I have invested fairly heavily on walking and camping stuff this past year, I am not enjoying the idea of bike maintenance costs on top of these.

5) Anyone had experience of using panniers / rucksacks for carrying camping stuff whilst on a bike?

Anyhow, I will be going out for a little ride over Cannock Chase on sunday, weather permitting, and provided my bike rack comes. Neither my knee nor I am prepared for the 13 mile each way road ride the Cannock as I used to do back in my yuff.
