title: 'Post arthroscopy report 1 (24 hours later)'

---
Went to hospital yesterday for the arthroscopy and now, 24 hours later, he is
the news....

Well, the operation generally went well, went to the Bupa Little Aston Hospital
at midday, and admission process completed about 1. After a bit of a lie down, i
finally went into theatre about 2 and was out about 3. I finally came around
about 4 though was in and out right through till 6ish when my parents picked me
up. The surgeon said all went ok, though I had done some damage to the knee
joint. This would probably lead to some occasional niggles. Fingers crossed
these won't stop my long distance walking ambitions. I did my physio exercises
and left the hospital about 6.30.

After doing little yesterday evening other than watch a bit of t.v. and eat a
pizza, i had an early night. I woke this morning dreading the pain as the drugs
wore off. Nothing. No pain at all. Infact, to this time, the only discomfort I
have felt is the stitches slightly tugging under the bandages. I have had no
extra painkillers. I have been walking around a bit today, doing some exercises
and even some wii tennis (but don't tell anyone!!).

Looking forward to tonight's [Mountain](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mountain/) and
Bowfell and Crinkle Crags on Wainwrights Walks. As close as I will be getting to
mountains for a couple of months me thinks.
