title: 'Raining in the Chase'

---

A quick walk over the Chase today with Phil Sant. Signs of good weather weren't evident as we arrived at Glacial Stone car park - what with the rain, but at least is wasn't cold. We did two ~3 mile circuits firstly over Sherbrook Valley to Rifle Range Rd then down Abraham's Valley, Stepping Stones and through Brocton Coppice back to car. Second circuit included Katyns Memorial and the German War Cemetery before returning up Sherbrook Valley.

Good chat though maybe too much about work :( ....

No pics today as it was pissing it down most of the time. Oh and I didn't have the camera.
