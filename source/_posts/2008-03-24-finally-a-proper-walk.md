title: 'Finally!! A proper walk'

---

After about 8 months or so, I finally got a decent walk in today. Went over to Church Stretton with a couple of mates from work. Got over to Little Stretton by 11:00 and started walking up Ashes Hollow - my favorite route on the Mynd. Had some fun on the few rocky bits, and the water was higher than I remember so crossing was interesting...

However, at the top of the valley, we proceeded to Pole Bank, and swiftly turned around to North. This was where I started to get worried about the knee - it has always failed on the downhills, but as I started to proceed down Carding Mill Valley, I started to build confidence that it would be ok. Was VERY careful around Light Hollow Spout, but picked up speed right down into Church Stretton. After a quick break, we continued along Ludlow Rd back to the car. So 8 rocky miles, great fun, and a happy reintroduction to walking.

Not only did I enjoy today, but it also provided valuable feedback for tomorrows final consultation on the knee, and also filled me with confidence for the impending Lake District visit Wednesday night. Plan currently is a ride around Rydal on Thursday, then maybe a visit to Helm Crag on Friday before either camping or driving back. However, seeing the thunder / hail combination forecast for Friday, I think I will be driving back!!
