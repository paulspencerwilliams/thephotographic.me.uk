title: 'Brief respite from the Rum Chronicles...'

---

After the recent effort in messing and uploading photos, blogging and other things Rum, I am treating myself to my second backpack of the year this weekend - weather permitting. Plan is to drive up to Keswick Friday afternoon, then grab Â abus down to Grasmere. I will then walk over Easedale Tarn and the Langdale Pikes to camp somewhere along Stake Pass. Then, continue on Saturday morning past Angle / Styhead Tarns for my first ascent of the Gables. Once down, a quick saunter over Brandreth and Honister will give me my last saturday challenge - Dale Head for a wildcamp somewhere on the massif. Sunday will hopefully provide a gentle stroll down either down Borrowdale / Derwent valley or through Little Town - who can tell.

Anyhow, my eyes will be firmly on the weather reports - trip will not happen if the current thunderstorms prevail!!!
