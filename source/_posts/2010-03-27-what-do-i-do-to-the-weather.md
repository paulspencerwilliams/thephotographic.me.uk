Cheryl's mom and I have a running joke that whenever I plan a lakeland trip without Cheryl, I turn the weather sour...

Well, after last Sunday's beautiful spring walk, I had my hopes up for a great solo backpack and wildcamp from Langdale.

I spent my lunch breaks this week constructing a stove windshield and pot cosy. I spent this morning in the garage strugging but finally succeeding in packing my stuff into my OMM 35L rucksack except for the tent, that fits great into the 'Multi Sport Compressor'... Pack weight including water and food - 18lb; not bad at all.

Then, I spent much of this afternoon planning the route in finer detail. Done.

Or so I thought. About 4 o'clock, I looked at the bbc weather report to decide whether tomorrows ramble would be White Peaks or Shropshire. BBC weather said it would be fine in both places. But from the corner of my eye, I spotted snow forecast Wednesday. I had already seen a possible snow shower forest cast the usually pessimistic MWIS, but now the BBC!!

Further searched for weather locally, and yeah, heavy snow Tuesday night through Wednesday.

When I mentioned all this to Cheryl, I was about to say 'I ain't wildcamping at the top of a mountain next week, maybe I will wimp out and use a campsite...' but she interrupted suggesting that I will wimp out and use a youth hostel.

There is was, a seed planted. A couple of quick calls, and hopefully I will get accommodation in Buttermere and Keswick.

Now, all I need to do Tuesday night is replace my sleeping bag / tent in the rucksack with crampons and the ice axe!!! Oh, and fully winter gloves, hat and thermals.
