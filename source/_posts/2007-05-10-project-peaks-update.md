title: 'Project Peaks update'

---
Been a bit lazy with the blog updates over the last week due to other priorities
- coding HDB Filestore, suffering painful broken teeth and most exciting of
all.... Planning my new project - 
[Project Wildcamp]({% post_url 2007-05-14-project-wildcamp-is-a-go %})
but more of that in a future post.A few things have happened with Project Peaks
over the last couple of weeks. After the failure of Scafell attempt 1, we
decided on the weekend around the 20th May for attempt 2. Unfortunately Chris is
not available for this weekend, so current attendees will be Nick, Phil and
myself. We have booked a 2 tent pitch at [Church Stile
campsite[(http://www.churchstile.com).

This gives us a less technical and physically easier route up to Scafell Pike
via Brown Tongue / Lingmell Coll as recommended by uk.rec.walking.

The camping aspect is scary / exciting at present as current weather is a bit
rubbish. Still all can change in just over a week.
