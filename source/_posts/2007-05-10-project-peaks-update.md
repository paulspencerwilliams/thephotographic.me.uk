title: 'Project Peaks update'

---

Been a bit lazy with the blog updates over the last week due to other priorities - coding HDB Filestore, suffering painful broken teeth and most exciting of all.... planning my new project - <a href="http://paulswilliams.me.uk/walkingwithwilliams/?page_id=41" title="Project Wildcamp">Project Wildcamp</a> but more of that in a future post.A few things have happened with Project Peaks over the last couple of weeks. After the failure of Scafell attempt 1, we decided on the weekend around the 20th May for attempt 2. Unfortunately Chris is not available for this weekend, so current attendees will be Nick, Phil and myself. We have booked a 2 tent pitch at <a href="http://www.churchstile.com/" title="Church Stile campsite">Church Stile campsite</a>.

This gives us an easier (both technically and phyiscally) route up to Scafell Pike via Brown Tongue / Lingmell Coll as recommended by uk.rec.walking.

The camping aspect is scary / exciting at present as current weather is a bit rubbish. Still all can change in just over a week.
