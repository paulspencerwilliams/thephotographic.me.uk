Well, after July's Lake District disappointment, I've had a fairly hectic time. A little biking, a quick foray up Snowdon (without knee pain!) provided false confidence in my knee. Hence I went up to the Lake District a few weeks ago, attempting the Buttermere circuit - Red Pike to Haystacks to Fleetwith Pike. However, descending High Crag, the knee pain came back. This time, two osteopaths staying at the Buttermere YHA advised me to formally see an osteopath to confirm and treat a suspected lateral collateral ligament. So I did, visited a sports physio / osteopath in Tamworth last night that actually diagnosed IT Band syndrome. So, hopefully, a bit of massage, icing and ultrasound will hopefully see me back to fighting / walking / wildcamping health again. About time too, not been in the Laser Comp for about 5 months!!! Anyhow, hopefully upload some pics and a little text from next weeks trip to Cornwall...
