<div class="entry-content"><p>Well, phase 2 of my knee test started today.</p>

<p>Test methodology: attempt roughly half of the Edale skyline.</p>

<p>Hypothesis: my knee will work fine, no probs. Today the peaks, tomorrow the world, well several Wainwrights at least.</p>

<p>Observations: 1 nasty car crash, and early morning vista of clag covered tops,  a beautiful day with bucket loads of sun and cooling winds at just the right time. Oh and some crazy remote control kite things. V. cool.</p>

<p>Write up: started from Castleton, and today chose my scarpa sl and gaiters. Had enough of fell running shoes until spring now.</p>

<p>My route started by popping over Hollins  cross and back down to Edale. Then having had a chat with some mtbers, I started the scramble up Grindsbrook Clough. Maybe I was a little silly trying this kind of stuff, especially when I slipped on a slimy rock and ended up hugging a rock for dear life - I nearly ended up in the stream. At the top I turned left and had lunch on Crowden Tower. Nice M&amp;S ham and cheese sarnies!</p>

<p>Now, with the bad weather of recent, my heart rate started to increase as I came to my peat bog nemesis - Brown Knoll. Recollections of being thick down in methane releasing bog and the sight of three lads with peat up to their knees didn&#8217;t help, and I did think several times about chickening out and descending Jacob&#8217;s Ladder.</p>

<p>But now, the plan was set and I continued over the knoll. It wasn&#8217;t too bad up to the trig point but the ground was bad thereafter. Especially dodgy was one horizontal grough that was deceiving - normally vegetation means safe ground, but this grough had much grass yet wouldn&#8217;t take my weight. Luckily, I had been cautious and only put one foot down. As soon as I realised, the foot was out, and I retreated. I succeeded in beating the grough via a little run up and 5ft jump. Again, maybe stupid with the knee but hell, I don&#8217;t like peat.</p>

<p>Once the knoll was complete, the simple but tiring walk over Rushup edge then down the broken road to Castleton concluded a great walking day.</p>

<p>Conclusion 1: I felt no knee pain despite my rough calculations of 13.5 miles and 775 metres of ascent. I think the knee might be on it&#8217;s way to classification of fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Conclusion 2: My scarpas didn&#8217;t rub my ankle despite the physio foam donuts i normally wear in them.</p>

<p>Conclusion 3: I love getting to the car 5 minutes before a heavy downpour. It means I planned the walk perfectly ;)</p>
