<div class="entry-content"><p>Went out on Saturday for a change due to the snow. Not done any serious walking in the white stuff so was dead excited. Originally planned to do the Peaks again, attempt the Edale Skyline again, but was worried about road conditions; especially due to nearly getting stuck on Barr Beacon the night before. Instead, I went to Cannock to attempt a circuit.Left early and got to Chase Rd car park south of the Glacial Stone about 9 and promptly got stuck attempting the impossible - getting up the hill in a two wheel car. After aboutÂ  15 minutes of frantic driving including full gas reverse for about 1 minute solid, I freed the car and parked in a good position (well that&#8217;s what I thought).</p>

<p>I was suprised by the amount of snow over there. It seemed to vary from about 2 inches through 5 or 6 inches. Enough to come to top of the Scarpas. The original intention was to cover the 7 miles or so to Castle Ring then back to Stepping Stones via Rifle Range Corner. I did not factor the amount of effort walking in even this modest amount of snowÂ  would bring. After about 6 miles, I got to Severn Springs, spent 3 hours getting there and my legs were turning to jelly. Didn&#8217;t fancy walking back in the dark so abandoned the Castle Ring target and turned around.</p>

<p>On way back, I stopped at the Visitors Centre for a coffee and Apple/Cinnamon cake which gave an opportunity to reflect on walking in snow. I enjoyed it and learnt how much effort it took, and also how difficult navigation could be. Not being able to see paths, and recognize places that I know well was strange, un-comforting. It meant I had to use map and compass and even GPS for occasion grid references.</p>

<p>I got back to the car park at about 3 and noticed that the car was actually on a slight decline from the car park road. This meant reversing uphill (again) but this time, grip was absolutely absent. Spent about 5 minutes attempting to get out with no luck. Then a group of walkers passed and 4 people helped me reverse. Just a bit of weight on the bonnet was needed.</p>

<p>In the end, I did aboutÂ  12 miles with fairly negligable ascent. Took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157594528197018/">these</a> photos too.</p>
