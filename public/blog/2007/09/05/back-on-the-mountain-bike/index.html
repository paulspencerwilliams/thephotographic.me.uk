<div class="entry-content"><p>In my last session, my physio advised me to do some work on an exercise bike or
real bike to build my leg muscles up without impact. I haven&#8217;t been on my bike
for about 2 years, having been a keen mountain biker up until University days.</p>

<p>So I got the turbo trainer out last Sunday, and had a quick spin. Jeez, this
trainer is loud. Well, thats what I though until I realised it was the knobbly
tires. All I need to do is get some mtb slicks. Went to Leisure Lakes in
Wolverhampton, who could only provide 1.2 inch (real thin!) slicks which I
bought at Â£22.50 - ouch.</p>

<p>However, something happened in store that I was not expecting&#8230;. I fell in love
with bikes again. Now maybe I am just shallow and materialistic, but I mean,
come on!!! Loads of bikes, gleaming, metallic, em.. anodised aluminium. I was
impressed with my strength to not just buy one there and then. However, I didn&#8217;t
and whilst driving back home, fitting the new slick, and setting up the trainer,
I was thinking about riding the old bike for real.</p>

<p>The final decision to start biking again occurred about 3.5 nanoseconds after I
realised the slick tire / trainer combo wouldn&#8217;t work, and I would have to go
out on the bike properly to do any leg work.</p>

<p>I spent much of Sunday and Monday thinking more about going out onto the hills
and the walking / cycling choice. I have the following concerns:</p>

<p>1) Which pursuit is going to be best for my knee? Yeah, cycling can be bad,
especially with clipped pedals, but there is little / no impact - well apart
from unexpected face / tree impacts. Suppose, here the answer is there is NO
choice. I do not have to choose either as I can choose BOTH.</p>

<p>2) Will my bike be a good enough platform to run for the next year or so? It was
a real good bike 10 years ago, but time has moved on, it still has V-Brakes, and
the front and rear shocks are getting tired and sloppy. I have already been told
spare parts for the fork are no longer available. A new drivetrain will probably
be necessary also.</p>

<p>3) Which pursuit is best for my hill ambitions. I want to see a lot of more of
the Lakes, Wales and Scotland. You certainly see more (in terms of quantity) on
a bike due to extra speed. However, access to many fells, Munros etc are by foot
only. I also hate fuss and clutter in leisure time, and hate the prospect of
driving up-to the lakes with both walking gear and biking gear filling the car.
Having to truly secure the bike, toolbox etc when out walking and such like.</p>

<p>4) Cost. I have invested fairly heavily on walking and camping stuff this past
year, I am not enjoying the idea of bike maintenance costs on top of these.</p>

<p>5) Anyone had experience of using panniers / rucksacks for carrying camping
stuff whilst on a bike?</p>

<p>Anyhow, I will be going out for a little ride over Cannock Chase on sunday,
weather permitting, and provided my bike rack comes. Neither my knee nor I am
prepared for the 13 mile each way road ride the Cannock as I used to do back in
my yuff.</p>
