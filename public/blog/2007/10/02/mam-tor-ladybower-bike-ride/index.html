<div class="entry-content"><p>I visited the Castleton High Peak area on Sunday for a bike ride - it seems after my last knee consultation that I could have another 2 months of pain in leg from walking, so I am officially solely a mountain biker until christmas.  I will be trying 2- 3 mile walks ever 3 weeks or so to monitor progress, and my new hope is to be ready for some snowy walks:)Anyhow, I left Walsall about 9am due to being on call. Arriving at a lay-by just below Mam Tor, I scoffed some chicken sandwiches and promptly dropped down the broken road to Castleton. Some road miles got me to a rocky ascent up the side of Winhill and finally to Hope Cross. Unusually for me, I had not really sorted a definitive route as I have to play it by ear with the knee.</p>

<p>Unsure where to go next, I went left down an incredibly rocky bridleway to Ladybower. It was quite a shock how difficult this track is even with 3.5&#8221;/6&#8221; travel fore and aft. Slippy rocks with fair drops at slow speed is tricky. However, I managed it in one piece. I continued then along and over Ladybower to Bamford.</p>

<p>Again, due to lack of fore-planning, the map suggested a straight ride along the road through Hope back to Castleton and I obeyed. As I gathered a decent pace and felt fully of energy, I decided to ditch a possible Winnats Pass climb back to the car, and instead choose the tougher and more technical ascent of Hollin&#8217;s Cross then Mam Tor. This was a wise decision for at least 10 minutes, in-fact until I got off the road and onto bridleway. Several walkers were bemused that I was attempting the ascent, and were vindicated when I gave up and resorted to pushing the bike. I used to be happy with a 30lb rucksack but the same weight in an unwieldy bike does not make for an easy walk. After the first stage up-to a style, I tried riding again, but the technicality and now lack of food / energy lead to the inevitable - pushing right to the top of Mam Tor other than some token riding up the cobbled ridge path.</p>

<p>I was a little disappointed that the bridleway does not go over the absolute peak of Mam Tor, but rather skirts to the North side through some muddy rutted tracks to the road. Once this road was met, a simple fast downhill brought me back to the car, and the single most enjoyable banana and pepperoni feast I have ever had.</p>

<p>All in all, a good 23 miler with no knee pain at all, though much aching bum syndrome - if I have learnt anything from this day, it is to not rest for any time off the saddle. I am not sure whether it is blood flow returning to the hind quarters, or relieved pressure reactivating the nerves, but getting back on the bike was saw, as was sitting at a computer yesterday - now, where is that ring cushion</p>
