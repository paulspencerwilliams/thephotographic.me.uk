<div class="entry-content"><p>Here we go again - another walk, another injury. This time, its my left ankle bone rather than the right one. To recall a little history for those at the back, I bought some new Scarpa SLs, which were fine initially. However, after the second walk, I noticed my right ankle swelling up and becoming quite painful. Over the last few months, I have continued to wear them using various pieces of physiotherapy padding to relieve the pressure. This has had mixed results but after last week&#8217;s Scafell descent in pain, I decided to sell these, and buy some trail shoes which hopefully wouldn&#8217;t touch  my ankle bones.I spent some time last week researching various trainers, and maid the final choice of some North Face Hedgehogs. I went to Blacks at Tamworth, and tried a few shoes on. The best fit seemed to be from the Hedgehogs brother - the Terrainius - and I spent some time ensuring they didn&#8217;t rub the ankle bone.</p>

<p>Excited by the prospect of pain-free ankles, I went over to Church Stretton for a round of hills. The first couple of miles took my up and over Caer Caradoc and the Lawler - even running down hill. Very impressed with the shoes to this point, and had no issues with my knee either.</p>

<p>The trouble started when I reached the bottom. I had to walk about 3 miles back to Church Stretton along a relatively simple path. However, it had a slight left to right camber, not to severe, but enough to rotate my feet slightly with the result of the left shoe rubbing my ankle bone. Great! My ankle saving shoes were destroying my ankles. Back at home I looked and the shoes seem no higher than my Merrells which haven&#8217;t produced this problem.</p>

<p>Next steps are to get some thickish superfeet which might effectively lower the sidewalls, and consult a podiatrist. Maybe a set of casters would work better than these damn ankles!!!</p>
