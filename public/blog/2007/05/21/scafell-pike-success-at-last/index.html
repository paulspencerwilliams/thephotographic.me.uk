<div class="entry-content"><p>I am still recovering today from the weekends efforts and a couple of fillings at the dentist. However, I am also jubilant from Phil and my successful attempt on Scafell on Saturday.Friday morning at work, I foolishly made the comment that the weather looked good, and hoped it would last the weekend. Phil suggested we check the weather which we did. Wet snow, hail, risk of thunder, 40 mile an hour gusts and a 4 degree temperature with a wind chill of -8. It was at this point that Phil realised his hat and gloves were at home. Better get em on the way there!!!!<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/508151603_c6aa98cd53_m.jpg" title="Looking down from Hardknott Pass" alt="Looking down from Hardknott Pass" align="left" height="180" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="240" /></p>

<p>On the dot of 4pm, we left for Stafford initially for supplies and the aforementioned clothing. This combined with bad traffic on the M6 meant we didn&#8217;t get to Ambleside till 8pm meaning a dusk drive along Hardknott Pass / Wrynoss Pass. It was the first time Phil had driven this road and we were both surprised to smell slightly overheating brake pads half way down the later Hardknott descent. 1.5 hours it took to get to Nether Wasdale and another 15 minutes to the campsite field.</p>

<p>This meant a dark pitch  of the tents lite partially by Phil&#8217;s headlights. Interesting as this was the first pitch of my new Laser Competition. We finally got our heads down (in our own individual tents you mucky LSC puppies!!!!) around 11.30. <img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/199/508155377_f2340d970e_m.jpg" title="My tent on right, Phil's on left and Phil!" alt="My tent on right, Phil's on left and Phil!" align="right" height="180" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="240" />It was about 1am when I got to sleep and woke every 30 mins or so due to the gusts and my lack of confidence in the new tent, and my lack of experience pitching it. Luckily it survived as did I and finally got up about 6.30.</p>

<p>After cooking our inadequate breakfasts (due to my poor purchasing abilities!!), we paid the campsite and commenced the walk alongside the road to Wasdale Head. Wastwater looked majestic with decent waves from the wind and it&#8217;s screens guarding overhead. It was quite disconcerting that we were due to be walking above them in 5 hours or so.</p>

<p>We followed the popular trail up from Brackenclose, up Lingmell Gill. This was tiring though not too difficult until we turned right at the Hollow Stones towards Mickledore. Both the terrain and the weather made progress much slower, and a little disorientation followed as we approached the final scree slope then gully scramble up to Mickledore. I was concerned at first when I saw the gully as it immediately reminded me of pictures of Lord&#8217;s Rake. A check of compass and GPS confirmed this was not the case, and the scramble was ok if a little wet.</p>

<p>At the top of the Mickeldore, we stopped for lunch. It never fails to amaze how quickly body heat disappears when stationary and my hands became numb after taking my gloves off for a couple of minutes to eat a sausage sandwich. A bit more location checking and compass work took place, and we took a bearing to the summit. The boulder field on the Pike is a great place to get lost. Featureless in the fog other than the army of cairns marking the path to Lingmell Col. I promptly entertained the crowd on the summit by slipping on a rock. No damage done other than to my pride! <img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/216/508175491_a9c33e64e1.jpg" title="Phil (left) and me (right) on the Pike" alt="Phil (left) and me (right) on the Pike" align="top" height="375" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="500" /></p>

<p>On commencing the walk off the summit, we decided to abandoned the original plan to ascent Scafell and Illgill Head / Whin Rigg, and instead take the cairned route down to Lingmell Col and back to Wasdale Head. This was partially because we were knackered, and partially because we were a little frustrated and tired with the last hours in clag navigation. It was most definitely the right choice as half way down, my previous knee pains came back. I think this is due to overcorrection of my gait when the Scarpas rub my ankle. Anyway, this is the last time I wear the wretched SLs - seem good boots, but just don&#8217;t suit my right ankle.</p>

<p>With enthusiastic use of the Lekis, we made the NT campsite about 1.5 hours later.  After much bother with closed office, incorrect taxi numbers, lack of phone  reception etc etc, we finally managed to book a taxi to transport us to the campsite as I didn&#8217;t feel the 3 mile walk back would help the knee&#8217;s recovery. Back at Nether Wasdale, a quick shower, change of clothes and tidy up of the tent etc saw us prepared for the inevitable rock and roll night on the town. We went the Strand Hotel as The Screes Inn apparently had a  private party organised. We both eat great Chicken and Mushroom pies and I washed mine down the either a Terminate or &#8216;Erm home brewed Ale. Yum! Then like all rock and roll evenings we both retried to our (once again - individual tents!!) tents at about 9pm! I was fast asleep and probably snoring by 9.05.</p>

<p>Sunday morning brought along a lovely sunny start, we left camp about 8.30 and a beeline over Wrynoss Pass and to Ambleside to <a href="http://www.pippinscafebar.co.uk/" title="Pippin's Cafe, Ambleside">Pippin&#8217;s Cafe</a> where great breakfasts were munched. This fueled us for the final drive home, again in the warm sunshine.</p>
