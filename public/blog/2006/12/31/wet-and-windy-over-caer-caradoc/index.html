<div class="entry-content"><p>Went for another Shropshire walk yesterday. I was initially going to just walkt
over Caer Caradoc but as I reached the top I decided I would carry on over the
Lawler. After all, I was feeling fine and energetic, the weather was OK -
contrary to the forecast and I had loads of time. So off I went down over Little
Caradoc.</p>

<p>The weather held up fine as I started to climb the Lawler but deteriorated very
quickly. I was worried as it started hailing and I wondered the possibility of
the often accompanying thunder. Not a bad worry considering <a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6221167.stm">this</a>. However,
the adrenaline, and atrocious weather made me feel like a true mountaineer;
alone conquering unknown mountains far a field. This illusion was only shattered
by occasional walkers on their way down.</p>

<p>The wind was very strong blowing my poles and myself all over the place and it
didn&#8217;t get any better until I started to descend the other side.</p>

<p>It has been a while since I have done the Lawler and with the northern section
out of sight in my map case, I underestimated the time it would take to get off
the hill on the other side. Initially I worried about not being back home by
15:00 but worry increased lower down as I realised I only had till 14:00 on the
car park ticket. It was now 13:00 and I had about 3 miles to cover. 3 miles on
slippery, wet mud on a track I didn&#8217;t know and as I found out later, went up
hill!</p>

<p>Right, I was now on a mission. Not going to let car park Nazis charge me for
under payment. I even ran a bit, though Scarpa 3/4 season boots are a little
heavier and less flexible than my running shoes. Finally got to Church Stretton
at 14:30. I was relieved to get to the car and see no penalty notice under the
windscreen wiper. 1 - 0  to me ;)</p>

<p>Overall, despite the weather, I had a really good day that persisted until I hit
the M6 motorway. Damn Ikea sales coupled with heavy rain caused congestion and a
40mph speed limit :( Took 1 hour 40 minutes to the return 50 mile journey - a
record for me I think.</p>

<p>No photos, as exposing (no pun intended) the camera to the heavy rail would no
doubt knacker it.</p>
