  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a mammoth 2 or 3 weeks of calls to technical and customer support, I have finally got a MAC code from Orange and am transferring to Waitrose broadband. I know, I know, a bit wusy, and only 5gb transfer a month, but I am not a bit-torrrenter and their techy support etc is meant to be v. good. I have come to realize that reliability and customer support is actually very important when I am on call for our IT system. A reliable internet connection is what stands between a simple dial in / reboot a server or whatever from a 1 hour round trip to Lichfield to do the same from offices!</p>

<p>I also like the fact that they donate proceeds to charity.</p>

<p>Oh, and &#8216;big up da&#8217; http://www.orangeproblems.co.uk as they say in Staines.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After 4 months of pain and minimal walking (partially due to NHS 24 also!!) I have finally plucked up courage to visit a knee surgeon regarding my knee. I went on Thursday to Little Aston Bupa Hospital, and after a short consultation, discovered I had torn my cartilage. Not a bad tear, but a tear non the less. This no doubt has caused the walking pains I have suffered, and the fix - an arthroscopy. Bupa never fails to impress - I could have had my first consultation on the evening I first made contact with Bupa, and I am now booked in for the operation next Saturday.</p>

<p>I believe (and hopefully am not too ambitious) that I will be back on the hills in a couple of months! May just see the last rays of October&#8217;s sun before getting the Winter clothing out again. This discovery has obviously delayed project peaks and wildcamp until &#8216;08 now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a month or so of resting my knee from hill walks, I drove up to Edale on Thursday. I parked at layby just off Mam Tor, and walked over the Tor down to Edale. I then had great fun climbing up Grindesbrook Clough which was full of water from the previous rains. At the top, I turned right walking along the edge to Hope Cross.</p>

<p>My pace was quick as their were darkening clouds following me but they seperated as I got to the Cross and walked down towards Crimea Farm. I had also managed to avoid much water and mud which was a releif as was trying the Inov-8s again. However, at Crimea Farm, the water and mud started. I managed to tip toe around several until I got to a hugh muddy puddle onlooked by the farmer who was chainsawing some trees. He commented that I should speed up to avoid the oncoming rain, and I obeyed, continuing tiptoeing over stones through the puddle - followed shortly by tripping onto all fours in the mud. He chuckled and asked whether I was ok. I obviously said I was fine, and it was my stupid fault for trying to avoid the mud.</p>

<p>Anyway, I continued, still enjoying myself though with slightly wet feet. I do find the non waterproof approach annoying in these conditions though, as just as your feet dry, they get wet again!</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t untill I started the final descent from Win Hill that my right knee started to hurt again. It still hasn&#8217;t repired with a tight sharp pain on outer lower part of knee. It wasn&#8217;t too bad, and I managed to make decent progress to the car, but I am certainly not ready for bigger of even multiday walks yet. Maybe a claim on bupa is needed for some physio.</p>

<p>To continue my foolishness, I couldn&#8217;t be bothered to change into waterproofs as the rain started. The clouds seemed seperated and I thought only a quick shower would fall. Unfortatenly, it rained persistently for 1 hour until I got back to the car. Doh!! Also, when in the car, I didn&#8217;t take my wet socks off as I hadn&#8217;t brought a spare pair. I drove for about 30 miles before taking em off. Oh it smelt, but oh it was bliss, with the heating at 26 degrees just aimed at my sodden feet!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Suppose I better confess. It has been over a month since my last decent walk. Think that is the longest I have been over the last year. Why is this? Well firstly, to say that work is hectic is an understatement. I have been working at least 1 day per weekend over the last month, though this isn&#8217;t so bad due to the attrotious weather we have suffered recently.</p>

<p>Also, I have deliberately eased of the rambles to allow me knee to recover. This has been a constant worry for project peaks and the other stuff I was so looking forward to over the last couple of months. However, I can once again see light at the end of the tunnel - work should be easing off over the next couple of weeks, and I have 3 days of next week. I hope to spend much of this time in the Peak District, though I will probably be infront of the dell at work :(</p>

<p>July is also the month I have to get fit ready for Project Wildcamp - my quest to walk for a few days around the Lake District.</p>

<p>Only things that have really happened over the last few weeks are:</p>

<p>1) I brought some Inov-8 Mudrocs which I cristened over Cannock Chase and Sutton Park. No hills yet, but plenty of wet feet. My current opinion of of them is &#8216;jese, how could I wear those damn Scarpa SLs for so long!!&#8217;. At last, hopefully some shoes that don&#8217;t rub my ruddy ankles, and they are SO DAMN LIGHT.
2) Got a promotion at work, that finally shifts my focus towards java work, moving away from the evil that is MS$
3) Brought a Mac Pro to replace my Imac G5. Any offers gratefully received!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here we go again - another walk, another injury. This time, its my left ankle bone rather than the right one. To recall a little history for those at the back, I bought some new Scarpa SLs, which were fine initially. However, after the second walk, I noticed my right ankle swelling up and becoming quite painful. Over the last few months, I have continued to wear them using various pieces of physiotherapy padding to relieve the pressure. This has had mixed results but after last week&#8217;s Scafell descent in pain, I decided to sell these, and buy some trail shoes which hopefully wouldn&#8217;t touch  my ankle bones.I spent some time last week researching various trainers, and maid the final choice of some North Face Hedgehogs. I went to Blacks at Tamworth, and tried a few shoes on. The best fit seemed to be from the Hedgehogs brother - the Terrainius - and I spent some time ensuring they didn&#8217;t rub the ankle bone.</p>

<p>Excited by the prospect of pain-free ankles, I went over to Church Stretton for a round of hills. The first couple of miles took my up and over Caer Caradoc and the Lawler - even running down hill. Very impressed with the shoes to this point, and had no issues with my knee either.</p>

<p>The trouble started when I reached the bottom. I had to walk about 3 miles back to Church Stretton along a relatively simple path. However, it had a slight left to right camber, not to severe, but enough to rotate my feet slightly with the result of the left shoe rubbing my ankle bone. Great! My ankle saving shoes were destroying my ankles. Back at home I looked and the shoes seem no higher than my Merrells which haven&#8217;t produced this problem.</p>

<p>Next steps are to get some thickish superfeet which might effectively lower the sidewalls, and consult a podiatrist. Maybe a set of casters would work better than these damn ankles!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am still recovering today from the weekends efforts and a couple of fillings at the dentist. However, I am also jubilant from Phil and my successful attempt on Scafell on Saturday.Friday morning at work, I foolishly made the comment that the weather looked good, and hoped it would last the weekend. Phil suggested we check the weather which we did. Wet snow, hail, risk of thunder, 40 mile an hour gusts and a 4 degree temperature with a wind chill of -8. It was at this point that Phil realised his hat and gloves were at home. Better get em on the way there!!!!<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/508151603_c6aa98cd53_m.jpg" title="Looking down from Hardknott Pass" alt="Looking down from Hardknott Pass" align="left" height="180" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="240" /></p>

<p>On the dot of 4pm, we left for Stafford initially for supplies and the aforementioned clothing. This combined with bad traffic on the M6 meant we didn&#8217;t get to Ambleside till 8pm meaning a dusk drive along Hardknott Pass / Wrynoss Pass. It was the first time Phil had driven this road and we were both surprised to smell slightly overheating brake pads half way down the later Hardknott descent. 1.5 hours it took to get to Nether Wasdale and another 15 minutes to the campsite field.</p>

<p>This meant a dark pitch  of the tents lite partially by Phil&#8217;s headlights. Interesting as this was the first pitch of my new Laser Competition. We finally got our heads down (in our own individual tents you mucky LSC puppies!!!!) around 11.30. <img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/199/508155377_f2340d970e_m.jpg" title="My tent on right, Phil's on left and Phil!" alt="My tent on right, Phil's on left and Phil!" align="right" height="180" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="240" />It was about 1am when I got to sleep and woke every 30 mins or so due to the gusts and my lack of confidence in the new tent, and my lack of experience pitching it. Luckily it survived as did I and finally got up about 6.30.</p>

<p>After cooking our inadequate breakfasts (due to my poor purchasing abilities!!), we paid the campsite and commenced the walk alongside the road to Wasdale Head. Wastwater looked majestic with decent waves from the wind and it&#8217;s screens guarding overhead. It was quite disconcerting that we were due to be walking above them in 5 hours or so.</p>

<p>We followed the popular trail up from Brackenclose, up Lingmell Gill. This was tiring though not too difficult until we turned right at the Hollow Stones towards Mickledore. Both the terrain and the weather made progress much slower, and a little disorientation followed as we approached the final scree slope then gully scramble up to Mickledore. I was concerned at first when I saw the gully as it immediately reminded me of pictures of Lord&#8217;s Rake. A check of compass and GPS confirmed this was not the case, and the scramble was ok if a little wet.</p>

<p>At the top of the Mickeldore, we stopped for lunch. It never fails to amaze how quickly body heat disappears when stationary and my hands became numb after taking my gloves off for a couple of minutes to eat a sausage sandwich. A bit more location checking and compass work took place, and we took a bearing to the summit. The boulder field on the Pike is a great place to get lost. Featureless in the fog other than the army of cairns marking the path to Lingmell Col. I promptly entertained the crowd on the summit by slipping on a rock. No damage done other than to my pride! <img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/216/508175491_a9c33e64e1.jpg" title="Phil (left) and me (right) on the Pike" alt="Phil (left) and me (right) on the Pike" align="top" height="375" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="500" /></p>

<p>On commencing the walk off the summit, we decided to abandoned the original plan to ascent Scafell and Illgill Head / Whin Rigg, and instead take the cairned route down to Lingmell Col and back to Wasdale Head. This was partially because we were knackered, and partially because we were a little frustrated and tired with the last hours in clag navigation. It was most definitely the right choice as half way down, my previous knee pains came back. I think this is due to overcorrection of my gait when the Scarpas rub my ankle. Anyway, this is the last time I wear the wretched SLs - seem good boots, but just don&#8217;t suit my right ankle.</p>

<p>With enthusiastic use of the Lekis, we made the NT campsite about 1.5 hours later.  After much bother with closed office, incorrect taxi numbers, lack of phone  reception etc etc, we finally managed to book a taxi to transport us to the campsite as I didn&#8217;t feel the 3 mile walk back would help the knee&#8217;s recovery. Back at Nether Wasdale, a quick shower, change of clothes and tidy up of the tent etc saw us prepared for the inevitable rock and roll night on the town. We went the Strand Hotel as The Screes Inn apparently had a  private party organised. We both eat great Chicken and Mushroom pies and I washed mine down the either a Terminate or &#8216;Erm home brewed Ale. Yum! Then like all rock and roll evenings we both retried to our (once again - individual tents!!) tents at about 9pm! I was fast asleep and probably snoring by 9.05.</p>

<p>Sunday morning brought along a lovely sunny start, we left camp about 8.30 and a beeline over Wrynoss Pass and to Ambleside to <a href="http://www.pippinscafebar.co.uk/" title="Pippin's Cafe, Ambleside">Pippin&#8217;s Cafe</a> where great breakfasts were munched. This fueled us for the final drive home, again in the warm sunshine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Spoke to <a href="http://www.terra-nova.co.uk" title="Terra Nova site">Terra Nova</a> and <a href="http://www.theoutdoorshop.com" title="The outdoor shop">The Outdoor Shop</a> today to sort out knackered carbon fibre tent pegs. Terra Nova wouldn&#8217;t move from their default &#8216;we can replace like with like or offer a downgrade to aluminium pegs&#8217; - not good. Luckily The Outdoor Shop was a little more sympathetic. They hadn&#8217;t heard of other stories of these problems but agreed in principle in replacing the pegs with like for like - including same price replacement. As the only good lightweight skewers offered by Terra Nova were the Titanium Skewers, they offered me these provided I pay the difference - normally nothing, but their discount price means I have to pay Â£6.02. I am not too peeved but think they could have offered them for nothing.</p>

<p>Still, hopefully next I should be the proud owner of some more titanium to go with my MSR cutlery set. Oh yeah, and I go to the lakes in only, er, 45 hours or so:)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As stated recently, I have brought a Terra Nova Laser Competition tent forming the shelter for Project Peaks. After listing to a recent backpackinglight.co.uk podcast about rucksacks, I decided to review how to pack my rucksack. I had tried last week to get my stuff into a Deuter 32 Futera unsuccessfully. The podcast suggesting separating the various parts of the tent / shelter across different parts of the &#8216;sack.</p>

<p>Whilst reviewing the bits of the tent, I noticed one of the ends to a peg had come lose - remember I haven&#8217;t had one (tent) erection yet! Em. not good. Whilst looking on the net, I found the pragmatic solution would be to superglue the ends onto the carbon fibre peg poles. However, should I really be resorting to superglue on my new 240 quid (RRP) toy? I think not.</p>

<p>I know Terra Nova produce some Titanium pegs for a the same RRP as the carbon fibre pegs I have. Therefore I think a straight swap or replacement guaranteed carbon pegs would be in order. I don&#8217;t think tent pegs are the kind of things I can p**s around with as failure is more than a mere inconvenience.</p>

<p>I am eagerly awaiting Terra Nova&#8217;s customer services reply.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been finalising my kit list and purchasing to allow <a href="http://paulswilliams.me.uk/walkingwithwilliams/?page_id=41" title="Project Wildcamp">project wildcamp</a> to start. A descent backpack is my last purchase, and this was unexpected - I was maybe a little optimistic to think my semi lightweight would fit in my 32l Deuter 32 Futura. This Friday is the day of reckoning, where I will test the tent, stove and sleeping bag and judging by the previous few days, a baptism of fire (well rain / mud) is looking likely.</p>

<p>In parallel to planning Project Peaks, I have started to devote time to planning at least one full length walk of the Peak District and possibly a a solo crossing the Shropshire hills before letting the tent loose in the Lakes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After the previous attempt, I have rallied the troups and refined the plans for the 2nd attempt on Scafell Pike (I know, I know, not quite the Eiger). Unfortunately it appears two of the original troups might not be able to attend so it falls on Phil and myself. We have walked together a few times and I have little doubt that we will make it this time. However, I am in doubt that I will be able to walk again after it - general erosion of the feet is assured by the 15 mile / 1670 metre ascent route (yeah thats 1.7 Scafell Pikes).Â  This was brought about the by equally stupid ideas:</p>

<ul>
    <li>to walk from the campsite at the other end of Wastwater which is 3 miles long!</li>
    <li>to do both Scafell Pike and Scafell and the further re-ascent needed to gain Illgill Head overlooking Wastwater.</li>
</ul>


<p>Still, if you are going to do the highest mountain in England, you might as well do it right, and whats more traditional than in the driving rain forecast.</p>

<p>The rest of the plan is roughly, drive quicly from work to Lake District and hopefully traverse the Wrynose / Hardknott pass road to Nether Wasdale by about 8pm (did I mention I was optimistic). This will allow for a sunlit erection of the tents and maybe a pint or 3 in the Screes Inn.</p>

<p>Saturday, we cook, walk, sleep.</p>

<p>Sunday, I hopefully have my way and go to Winwood Outdoors to try some lightweight backpacks. However it&#8217;s Keswick Mountain Festival time I think so I am not looking forward to the crowds. Sunday afternoon, time to drive home me thinks.</p>
