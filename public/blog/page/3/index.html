  <div class="entry-content"><p>The knee works! yah!! Well, I say works as i survived a 10 miler derwent edge circuit today. However, my feet didn&#8217;t. After using trail shoes solely this year from about February, with the recent wet weather and boggy ground on the edge, I knew it was a gamble to try them over my boots and gaiters. But I tried, and to be honest, my feet weren&#8217;t too cold, I had thick smartwool socks and the temperatue was about 5 - 6 degrees in the valley.</p>

<p>However, by the end of the walk, my feet ached a little more than from the mileage alown, so next week, I will be trying the scarpa sls again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, after a month of osteopathy, my physician has mandated a decent hill walk to test the knee. Oh it&#8217;s a hard life. Well, tomorrow is the day, and Hope Valley is the destination. A quick walk up from Hope to Winhill Pike, some photos over Derwent Water and then back down the river Noe. Hopefully the knee won&#8217;t let me down. Just got to decide whether to wear my old SLs or trainers.. Wore the boots tonight to the Conkers firework display and they feel HEAVY!!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hopefully will be walking soon&#8230; Went to osteopath and physio in Tamworth a couple of weeks ago. After hearing my summary of my knee history, he performed some diagnostic tests and my problem is&#8230;</p>

<p>IT band syndrome, aka runner&#8217;s knee. Well, I will be annoyed if that has been the root cause for years as this is fairly simple to diagnose by physios and my previous physios did not pick this up. Therefore I might have gone through two arthroscopies for nothing. Well at least mr Bupa paid for them!!! Anyhows, I am icing the knee asbi type, and have been doing some massage. I have also got my second Physio appointment tomorrow evening and am (not) looking forward to some deep sports massage. Still, anything to get me back walking. My poor laser comp as only seen 4 nights use this year and i really want to try the kinder circuit during the Xmas break&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, after July&#8217;s Lake District disappointment, I&#8217;ve had a fairly hectic time. A little biking, a quick foray up Snowdon (without knee pain!) provided false confidence in my knee. Hence I went up to the Lake District a few weeks ago, attempting the Buttermere circuit - Red Pike to Haystacks to Fleetwith Pike. However, descending High Crag, the knee pain came back. This time, two osteopaths staying at the Buttermere YHA advised me to formally see an osteopath to confirm and treat a suspected lateral collateral ligament. So I did, visited a sports physio / osteopath in Tamworth last night that actually diagnosed IT Band syndrome. So, hopefully, a bit of massage, icing and ultrasound will hopefully see me back to fighting / walking / wildcamping health again. About time too, not been in the Laser Comp for about 5 months!!! Anyhow, hopefully upload some pics and a little text from next weeks trip to Cornwall&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The good:</p>

<p>Got to the lakes in the end!! Drove up Friday night but due to the consistent rain on the last part of the M6, I once again chickened out of wildcamping, instead taking the easier option of camping at the Castlerigg Hall campsite - one of my favourites.</p>

<p>Friday evening saw nothing of great interest though did get a new jacket and most interesting - the annoying OMM Chest Pouch - more of that later. Anyhow, a couple of drinks whilst studing the map provided the inspriation for Saturdays new route - an extended Newlands Valley horseshoe.</p>

<p>An early morning saw me leave the campsite by 08:00. I walked through Keswick from the campsite, then over the base of Catbells, through Little Town to finally reach the first mountain of the day - Robinson. At the summit, I turned left over Hinescarth Edge to Dale Head. Here, once again, I turned left to Maiden Moor.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;368&#8221; caption=&#8221;Tarn on Robinson&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157620866238573/"><img class="  " title="Tarn on Robinson" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2505/3690648029_e011ce6070_b.jpg" alt="Tarn on Robinson" width="368" height="277" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>All in all, a great walk, and I had only a minor descent then climb to Catbells, and the stroll back to Keswick&#8230;.</p>

<p>The bad:</p>

<p>Then it happened. strolling down Maiden Moor, on slightly rough ground I felt a sudden twinge in my right (bad) knee. Oh oh. Still, doesn&#8217;t hurt. I carried out, really carefully, but over the next 10 minutes, the pain started. Exactly the same pain (to a lesser degree) to my pre arthroscopy. I new I shouldn&#8217;t complete catbells, so got down to the lake side. Interestingly, I managed the 5 miles or so to Keswick with little discomfort.</p>

<p>Popped in to the Bank Tavern for a pint (for medicinal purposes) but it was too busy. I was shattered and the faff of standing having a cider was too much. Instead, I got a taxi back to the campsite, and tried their new restaurant - a nice garlic mushroom / lasagna washed down with some white wine. Nice.</p>

<p>The ugly:</p>

<p>Well, not actualy ugly, but the most memorable part of the walk, other than the knee, was the OMM Chest Pouch. I really like the idea of it - especially to store my Powershot G6, and some snacks. And for this, its size and shape are perfect. Using my beanie hat to wrap the camera seems to provide enough protection for simple walking. I would put the camera back in the main sack if I was on a proper scramble though.</p>

<p>What I disliked was the difficulty of getting the ruck sack on and off. Now, I haven&#8217;t read up about ways of using the pouch, so there might well be work arounds, but I found the easiest way to get the sack off and on was to slacken the shoulder straps to their loosest, then twist the rucksack so I am almost hugging it. From there, I can lift it over my head. Now, this is neither convenient, nor ergonomic. Lucky I had little weight in the sack. However, I did like the different storage options the pouch opens up. Especially when the clouds appeared - I could easily store my waterproof trousers in there to put on quickly if the rain did come. I think I could also get the Marmot Mica in as well, but its immediate access is of less importance when it takes 2 minutes to get the rucksack off!!!</p>

<p>Anyhows, I have uploaded some photos, and all that remains is for me to phone the physio and surgeon to see what I should do next with the knee&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After the recent effort in messing and uploading photos, blogging and other things Rum, I am treating myself to my second backpack of the year this weekend - weather permitting. Plan is to drive up to Keswick Friday afternoon, then grab  abus down to Grasmere. I will then walk over Easedale Tarn and the Langdale Pikes to camp somewhere along Stake Pass. Then, continue on Saturday morning past Angle / Styhead Tarns for my first ascent of the Gables. Once down, a quick saunter over Brandreth and Honister will give me my last saturday challenge - Dale Head for a wildcamp somewhere on the massif. Sunday will hopefully provide a gentle stroll down either down Borrowdale / Derwent valley or through Little Town - who can tell.</p>

<p>Anyhow, my eyes will be firmly on the weather reports - trip will not happen if the current thunderstorms prevail!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got up on the Monday morning, packed and went down stairs for breakfast. Interesting guest house - a glass of OJ already sits next to your plate, and the landlady asks what cereals you would like - then serves you a bowl with milk poured. Anyhow, we sat on the same table as a father / son (Daniel) from Newcastle way. No, I am not exagerating when I say the kid was probably the cleverest 8ish year old I have ever met, as had an unbelievable confidence with it. He led the conversation over breakfast, and amazed reciting all the train stations, in order the they passed from Newcastle to Mallaig. He had also found their train tickets - a bargain deal no less.</p>

<p>Although it was a nice conversation and good breakfast, we were eager to leave to ensure to catch the ferry. However, this was not helped by the landlady being very friendly and talkative! However, we got to the ferry terminal with about 20 minutes to spare. The ferry was larger than I expected, and thus calmed any sea sickness fears. [caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignleft&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Isle of Rum photos&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157619939085536/"><img class=" " title="Eigg from the ferry" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2427/3651070941_303e24d785.jpg" alt="Isle of Rum photos" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>The scenery was amazing on the ferry, and a helpful  and knowledgeable passenger pointed out some significant mountains / areas of the mainland, most noticably the Knoydart peninsular. The quick stop off at Eigg showed us the impressive edges of the island, and finally we started to journey to Rum proper. The views up Glen Kinloch starting at the castle - truly amazing, but the views up Askival and Hallival rising majestically from the sea were concerning - we would be walking up their tomorrow&#8230;.</p>

<p>Anyhows, our initial impressions of Kinloch Castle (after the 1/2 mile walk) were good. A beautiful building in fantasitc surroundings, but as we entered, the confirmation of some slight apprehension became apparent - it was definately more hostel than hotel. Further walking thrugh the building took us past a veritable building site. It&#8217;s funny how your views change - intially we were both dissapointed at the state of the room and building internally. Much dust, and lack of new building comforts such as locking bedroom doors didn&#8217;t help. Finally, the meals were tasty if basic.</p>

<p>However, it was through staying on the island and speaking to the locals did we start to understand the community nature of the island. Most people on the island live and / or work at the hostel carrying out work from cooking / cleaning to basic maintainence and simiar. Not like normal &#8216;hotel&#8217; staff. The hostel is the main focal point in the community - its the employer, the hub, the drinking point, the reason people come to the island and contribute so heavily to its finances.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Isle of Rum photos&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157619939085536/"><img class=" " title="Kinloch Castle" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2471/3653411282_39493d6ed0.jpg" alt="Isle of Rum photos" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Its also strange to see the layed back and trusting nature of the people living here - little things like people using other peoples cars without asking - unthinkable in our modern town lifestyles.</p>

<p>The next morning saw our first main walk on Rum - from the Castle, through Coire Dubh onto the Bealach Bairc Mheall. On reaching the Bealach, we would skirt Hallival to the East contouring above Atlantic Corrie along the scree slope on the north ridge of Askival. The walk to the ridge was ok, but as we started the final scramble up on the north face of the summit, the scree and exposure became too much and we decided to eat our sandwiches, the descend east to meet the coastal path back to the castle. I was initially dissapointed to not reach the true summit, but all was forgotten when Cheryl noticed a large bird in the sky - surely not - yes, it could be&#8230; Yeah, it was definately an eagle - a massive creature that at one point flew pretty much straight over us, albeit probably 500 ft above. And it&#8217;s flight flicked between soaring on thermals and upwinds to acrobatic falling and turning. However, I could not identify it as either Golden or White Tailed.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignleft&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Isle of Rum photos&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157619939085536/"><img class=" " title="Cheryl looking to the mainland from Hallival / Askival ridge" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3260/3654305125_a368ccd222.jpg" alt="Isle of Rum photos" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Anyhow, the we continued down, off the summit meeting the coastal path, which provided great views of the mainland at the beginning, then as we changed direction, the Isle of Sky&#8217;s dramatic black cuillen dominated. Some local features such as deer and waterfalls provided some interested and we arrived back at the castle approx 16:00. A laze around the castle followed by dinner concluded with some wine and whiskey back in the bar with lots of locals. A relativley early night fuelled us for the next day - my introduction to midges!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right, the last post left off two Sundays ago when we left Keswick in the morning. Plan for the day was simple, drive up to Loch Lomond, grab some dinner and then continue to <a title="Wikipedia article on Mallaig" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallaig">Mallaig</a>.As we saw initial signs for the first motorway service station, we noticed the Marks and Spencers sign. Although we had only had breakfast an hour ago, the wish for some nice M&amp;S sarnies was too much to ignore, so we popped in to grab some - their purpose would be a dinner backup in case our initial research into lack of pubs in Mallaig was correct.</p>

<p>The drive was interesting upto Loch Lomond, having to drive through Glasgow proper, lots of complicated dual carriageways through the city, but luckily TomTom didn&#8217;t let us down. Now, I always wanted to try some authentic Scottish cuisine during the trip, so we decided to eat at a local Scottish restaurant in Balloch, south of Loch Lomond. A place called McDonalds, where I tried a &#8216;Big Mac&#8217; and Cheryl had a burger and &#8216;McChicken Nuggets&#8217;, and nice they were too.</p>

<p>Back in the car, we stopped for the last time at Inverglas, parking at the visitors centre and taking pics of &#8216;The Ben&#8217; - our target for the following Thursday. Loch Lomond is a beautiful lake, with some majestic hills surrounding. However, I was getting excited&#8230;.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;240&#8221; caption=&#8221;Buachaille Etive Mòr&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/3648087564/"><img title="Buachaille Etive Mòr" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3415/3648087564_758c292c3f_m.jpg" alt="Buachaille Etive Mòr on the right of Glen Etive" width="240" height="180" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>The drive up the A82 had already seen some great roads, nice bends etc, and I knew the best was to come - from the Bridge of Orchy through Glen Coe then the A830 Road to the Isles. So back in the car, and I took great pleasure from the pretty  open roads, and lack of slow cars in front. A few easy overtakes and we were through Glen Coe. However, a a reminder about road safety was clear - a police car and ambulance were on scene just before the visitors centre to assist a car that had made it over a ditch, albeit it upside on it&#8217;s roof. Pretty hairy scene. Anyhow, a couple of brief photo stops by <a title="Wikipedia article on Buachaille Etive Mòr" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buachaille_Etive_Mòr">The Buckle</a> and a sea loch just before Mallaig satisfied by urges to see the best of Highland scenery.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignleft&#8221; width=&#8221;240&#8221; caption=&#8221;Eigg and Rum from Mallaig&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157619939085536/"><img title="Eigg and Rum from Mallaig" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3352/3647407557_37fd2e36d8_m.jpg" alt="Eigg and Rum from Mallaig" width="240" height="180" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>We finally got to The Moorings Guest House at Mallaig about 8ish, booked in and took the landladies advise to walk over the hill overlooking the harbour. Quite a hill, the walk taking about 1 hour though this did include eating those M&amp;S sarnies and taking many photos of Eigg, Rum and Skye. Fantastic scenery, beautiful weather rounded off by a bottle of Rosé whilst watching The Apprentice Finale in our room.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right, here is my first post about our first trip to Rum, and my first trip to the Scottish Highlands. Basic itinery for the visit was&#8230;.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" title="Rum from the Mallaig ferry" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3340/3639704602_f80ec13b2a.jpg" alt="Our first proper view of Rum from the ferry" width="180" height="135" />Drive to Mallaig, ferry to Rum, do Askival, then ferry back, and camp at Loch Lomond hopefully doing my first Munro - The Ben. However, to break the 453 mile journey between home and Mallaig, we would stay in the Lakes during the weekend before the ferry to Rum  and camp in Yorkshire on the way back.</p>

<p>After some thought about where to stay in the Lakes, I decided upon Clarence House, Keswick which was great - nice and close to town thus enabling any drunken stumbles back from the pub, and breakfast was nice. Saturday morning was spent around town buying some nice Salamon Quest boots for cheryl - very light for relatively high ankled boots. Props to George Fisher for excellent boot fixing service.</p>

<p>Once we had recovered from a wallet bashing, we tried some authentic lake district grub  from Greggs the bakers - a pastie and sausage roll eaten outside a women&#8217;s clothes shop - classy!  At least we managed sufficient calories to enable us to complete Catbells despite the hail and rain. Gear report alert - Cheryl&#8217;s boots and new Pacer Poles both performance brilliantly!</p>

<p>Back in Keswick, we had Saturday dinner at the Bank Tavern which was great, although we did break the no pudding rule of the holiday! What the hell, we still had a Corbett and Munro over the next few days to burn it off, and that sticky toffee pudding was worth it.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, we enjoyed breakfast before starting the mammoth drive north to the fishing village of Mallaig to get the ferry to Rum.</p>

<p>More to continue&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right, once again, apologies for not blogging recently. Just been too busy. So what have I been doing recently?</p>

<p>Firstly, me and the missus camped in Wasdale at the beginning of April to celebrate our first year together. We drove up Friday evening and pitched the tents at Church Stile / Nether Wasdale. Saturday, I introduced &#8216;her outside&#8217; to Lakeland mountain biking over Windemere way. She now respects even smaller Lakeland hills. Tough day, but dinner in the Screes warmed us enough to get through a very cold night. </p>

<p>Sunday was meant to see an easy walk up and over the screes. The first parts - uphill and accorss the top were and we decended on the far side of Wastwater by about 2. However, the return screeful (is that a word?) leg along Wastwater was an education on why to never underestimate cumbrian &#8216;footpaths&#8217;. 2 hours later after only maybe 3 miles, and we finally got back to camp about 7. We were shattered, and I was sunburnt. However, after some camp cooked pasta, we were up for a pint or 3 in the screes again. Nice. </p>

<p>Good weekend.</p>
