  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, another couple of weeks have gone since posting so thought I better update&#8230;</p>

<p>Firstly, still loving the new bike. Definitely made the right choice for my kind of riding. Much faster and more responsive than the old Marin around smoother rides like Follow The Dog. Even keeping it immaculate washing straight after ride (though that might diminish after the first scratch..).</p>

<p>Haven&#8217;t ridden or walked since Cannock last Wednesday mainly due to the weather. Its great, I was desperate for some decent snow last year, to learn some crampon use, but this year, no such antics are possible with the knee. So last thing I want is snow, as it isn&#8217;t very mountain bike compatible, and this winter looks set to be cold.</p>

<p>The rest of this week entails:
1) Bike ride around Sutton Park tomorrow afternoon after hopefully getting my new HTC mobile phone / pda thingy.
2) Attending Project Managers leaving do on Thursday evening
k
3) Last and certainly not least, packing Thursday evening for a fun and scenery packed visit to Keswick and virgin ride around Derwent Water doing the &#8216;Borrowdale Bash&#8217;. Standard outdoorsy Lake District fodder of driving up Friday evening, fun on Saturday, then maybe some photography Sunday morning before driving back. I have got to test my knee before final consultation on 4th Dec, so might do Catbells if the weather aint too bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I rode the <a href="http://www.chasetrails.co.uk/">Follow The Dog</a> mountain bike trail at Cannock Chase for the first time. Great ride, and first purpose built XC trail I have tried and I love it. Brilliant twisty singletrack that go on forever, with fun bermed curves. The weather was great and the bike didn&#8217;t get too dirty which is a bonus in November. Also reckied it for some night riding but think I will have to familiarize it more before trying under lights. Did about 10 miles in total and felt nothing from my knee :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since my last post, things have happened quite quickly on the bike scene. As some will know, my knee still isn&#8217;t right and this has led to a reduction in walking, and hence posting here. Also, my physiotherapist suggested cycling as an exercise to help with recovery. I used to mountain bike years ago, and haven&#8217;t been on a bike for about 2 years. So the last couple of months, I have been on my old Marin several times, and during some thought on upgrading it inline with the 21st century, I  decided to replace it altogether.</p>

<p>I went upto Hawes a few weeks ago to test ride an Orange P7, and really liked it. So much so that I ordered a couple of Mondays ago, but due to hivering and hovering about sizing, spec etc, I messed up the order. This combined with an Orange stocktake, meant I would have to wait until  mid November for the bike.</p>

<p>How surprised was I yesterday, when I got a call from Swinnertons @ cannock to inform me the bike was ready. Although I needed to complete doing our flat roof and the guttering due to the roof leaking, the call of fancy new equipment was too strong, and I picked it up on way back from getting our power washer serviced. At home, I  took the obligatory <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157602884577867">pics</a> and attached a crud catcher and some
frame protection.</p>

<p>My original plans for today were to sit on the turbo trainer for a couple of hours, as I still don&#8217;t trust my knee sufficiently to go out proper riding just yet, but the new bike was sufficient to force a trip over Sutton Park, albeit driving their to avoid Barr Beacon. I only did a single circuit of the park, but it was great fun - riding hardtails is so much fun having to actually pick lines rather than tumble over anything on a bouncer. Maybe some of the fun came from the newness factor also though.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it was a good day, and now that I have just sold my old Imac, I have ordered some more tools to treat the bike to some TLC.</p>

<p>The only outdoors thing to happen last week was a further discussion with Phil Sant about a few day trek around the Lakes next year. Probably set up a base camp  at Langdale, and do some circulars or hopefully two dayers from there on. Oh, and I have my final knee consultation in exactly 1 month. Just hope the knee is fully mended for than as its been 4 months since last walk and I am eagerly awaiting the call of contour lines again!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am camping at Keswick Saturday night, and am looking for some good photographic spots around there, or on the journey back south to Kendal. I can not walk far from the car (maybe  1-2 mile round trip) due to the knee issue, and really want to capture some great views - mind I suppose there aren&#8217;t many bad views in the Lakes.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I visited the Castleton High Peak area on Sunday for a bike ride - it seems after my last knee consultation that I could have another 2 months of pain in leg from walking, so I am officially solely a mountain biker until christmas.  I will be trying 2- 3 mile walks ever 3 weeks or so to monitor progress, and my new hope is to be ready for some snowy walks:)Anyhow, I left Walsall about 9am due to being on call. Arriving at a lay-by just below Mam Tor, I scoffed some chicken sandwiches and promptly dropped down the broken road to Castleton. Some road miles got me to a rocky ascent up the side of Winhill and finally to Hope Cross. Unusually for me, I had not really sorted a definitive route as I have to play it by ear with the knee.</p>

<p>Unsure where to go next, I went left down an incredibly rocky bridleway to Ladybower. It was quite a shock how difficult this track is even with 3.5&#8221;/6&#8221; travel fore and aft. Slippy rocks with fair drops at slow speed is tricky. However, I managed it in one piece. I continued then along and over Ladybower to Bamford.</p>

<p>Again, due to lack of fore-planning, the map suggested a straight ride along the road through Hope back to Castleton and I obeyed. As I gathered a decent pace and felt fully of energy, I decided to ditch a possible Winnats Pass climb back to the car, and instead choose the tougher and more technical ascent of Hollin&#8217;s Cross then Mam Tor. This was a wise decision for at least 10 minutes, in-fact until I got off the road and onto bridleway. Several walkers were bemused that I was attempting the ascent, and were vindicated when I gave up and resorted to pushing the bike. I used to be happy with a 30lb rucksack but the same weight in an unwieldy bike does not make for an easy walk. After the first stage up-to a style, I tried riding again, but the technicality and now lack of food / energy lead to the inevitable - pushing right to the top of Mam Tor other than some token riding up the cobbled ridge path.</p>

<p>I was a little disappointed that the bridleway does not go over the absolute peak of Mam Tor, but rather skirts to the North side through some muddy rutted tracks to the road. Once this road was met, a simple fast downhill brought me back to the car, and the single most enjoyable banana and pepperoni feast I have ever had.</p>

<p>All in all, a good 23 miler with no knee pain at all, though much aching bum syndrome - if I have learnt anything from this day, it is to not rest for any time off the saddle. I am not sure whether it is blood flow returning to the hind quarters, or relieved pressure reactivating the nerves, but getting back on the bike was saw, as was sitting at a computer yesterday - now, where is that ring cushion</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, after Saturday&#8217;s sorry episode, I have brought forward my final consultation with the knee surgeon. It&#8217;s tomorrow - fingers crossed its something easy to fix. Think i will be pushing for mri scan this time!!</p>

<p>A while ago, I had decided to book every wednesday from beginning of October till Christmas off, so I could do two walks a week - Wednesday and a weekend day. Obviously, as I havn&#8217;t been walking but it seemed I could cycle, I thought I would go out today for an easy cycle - just to Sutton Park. The intention was to test the knee to make sure it worked on the bike, and this could be useful news for the surgeon.</p>

<p>So I did, and the knee did work. I cycled to the park - about 6 miles round trip, with a lap of around 7 miles. All the time, I was waiting for the discomfort, but it just didn&#8217;t come. Even up and over Barr Beacon, I managed to keep in decent gear with no pain. This afternoon, I cleaned the bike and visited Leisure Lakes in Wolves to buy some clothes, and even then, I only suffered slight muscle aches as normal after exercise.</p>

<p>So its baffling, the knee can&#8217;t handle a 1.5 mile walk, but 13 mile bike ride is fine - Go figure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went out today to see how my knee was. Was confident of little problems having done a 12 mile bike ride last Sunday without problem. Also, I have been doing a &gt;1 mile walk each day to the sandwich shop for lunch.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s agenda was a 3 miler around Sutton Park. A couple of small hills (only about 50 metre height gain) and easy ground. It started well, but as I turned to the home stretch, the knee pains started again. Exactly the same pain with similar intensity to pre-op. It has been 6 weeks since operation, and I had my last physio session so presumed this sorry episode was all over :(</p>

<p>Although I have 4 weeks to wait until final consultation, I will speak to Bupa Monday to arrange an earlier consultation, get this thing sorted once and for all. My main concern now, is whether it is only walking, or general activity that can start the knee pain. Again, after the bike ride last weekend, can I repeat a similar distance on Wednesday as I have the day booked of&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my last session, my physio advised me to do some work on an exercise bike or real bike to build my leg muscles up without impact. I haven&#8217;t been on my bike for about 2 years, having been a keen mountain biker up until University days.</p>

<p>So I got the turbo trainer out last Sunday, and had a quick spin. Jeez, this trainer is loud. Well, thats what I though until I realised it was the knobbly tires. All I need to do is get some mtb slicks. Went to Leisure Lakes in Wolverhampton, who could only provide 1.2 inch (real thin!) slicks which I bought at Â£22.50 - ouch.</p>

<p>However, something happened in store that I was not expecting&#8230;. I fell in love with bikes again. Now maybe I am just shallow and materialistic, but I mean, come on!!! Loads of bikes, gleaming, metallic, em.. anodised aluminium. I was impressed with my strength to not just buy one there and then. However, I didn&#8217;t and whilst driving back home, fitting the new slick, and setting up the trainer, I was thinking about riding the old bike for real.</p>

<p>The final decision to start biking again occurred about 3.5 nanoseconds after I realised the slick tire / trainer combo wouldn&#8217;t work, and I would have to go out on the bike properly to do any leg work.</p>

<p>I spent much of Sunday and Monday thinking more about going out onto the hills and the walking / cycling choice. I have the following concerns:</p>

<p>1) Which pursuit is going to be best for my knee? Yeah, cycling can be bad, especially with clipped pedals, but there is little / no impact - well apart from unexpected face / tree impacts. Suppose, here the answer is there is NO choice. I do not have to choose either as I can choose BOTH.</p>

<p>2) Will my bike be a good enough platform to run for the next year or so? It was a real good bike 10 years ago, but time has moved on, it still has V-Brakes, and the front and rear shocks are getting tired and sloppy. I have already been told spare parts for the fork are no longer available. A new drivetrain will probably be necessary also.</p>

<p>3) Which pursuit is best for my hill ambitions. I want to see a lot of more of the Lakes, Wales and Scotland. You certainly see more (in terms of quantity) on a bike due to extra speed. However, access to many fells, Munros etc are by foot only. I also hate fuss and clutter in leisure time, and hate the prospect of driving up-to the lakes with both walking gear and biking gear filling the car. Having to truly secure the bike, toolbox etc when out walking and such like.</p>

<p>4) Cost. I have invested fairly heavily on walking and camping stuff this past year, I am not enjoying the idea of bike maintenance costs on top of these.</p>

<p>5) Anyone had experience of using panniers / rucksacks for carrying camping stuff whilst on a bike?</p>

<p>Anyhow, I will be going out for a little ride over Cannock Chase on sunday, weather permitting, and provided my bike rack comes. Neither my knee nor I am prepared for the 13 mile each way road ride the Cannock as I used to do back in my yuff.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its been two weeks now since the arthroscopy so I thought it best to report progress. I have lost almost all discomfort from the knee. This is how it all happened:</p>

<p>Since the previous post, the knee got slightly worse until about 72 hours after the op. Walking around was miserable. Getting comfortable in bed was difficult. Lying on back had the duvet falling on the knee. Lying on either side would cause me leg to bend laterally - definately a non goer. Didn&#8217;t even try lying on my front as obviously the leg weight would be on the knee. However, after a couple of nights this easied a bit.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, I had my first physio appointment. I was slightly dissapointed in the male physio - only because I was hoping for the pretty (female!!!) physio who assessed my on operation day. Although not pretty, he was friendly and cautiously showed several exercises / stretches that would help recovery. He also stated the importance of icing the knee which i performed more after the session.</p>

<p>Gradually since then, the knee aches / pains and discomfort have reduced. I felt confident to be able to walk up stairs normally last saturday, and by Thursday, I was putting weight on the bad leg whilst walking downstairs on Thursday. Encouragingly, the worse problem this week was my knee stubble catching on suit trousers, oh and the disapproving looks of colleages when they saw my surgical stockings - oh, the embarrasement of white socks! Unfortunately, its too warm to wear socks over the tops of them.</p>

<p>I had my second physio session yesterday. Initial assessment was good. I could bend my leg nearly normally, and had no discomfort with the various leg manipulations conducted. I was then led to the gym, where I did 5 minutes on the exercise bike, and some body weight bearing excercises. This was good, I finally feel like I am redeveloping the leg muscles - its amazing how quickly they can waste. Finally, I was told that I could do easy 10 minute bike rides but NO HILLS and NO FORCE on the pedals - its all about spinning the cranks! Well, suppose I better pump up my tyres and put that XT derailleur on, both of which I have been putting off.</p>

<p>Generally, however, I am happy with progress and will be getting my stiches removed and having a follow up consultation on Tuesday. I can already feel the call of the OS maps, and possible Lake District walk in mid -  late autumn.</p>

<p>I am also thinking more about lightweight gear, minimising my pack weight seems all the more important now, reducing load on knees. Also I think some rubber ends to my poles would be a good purchase as I tend to only use poles on softer ground, and I want to maximse their use now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went to hospital yesterday for the arthroscopy and now, 24 hours later, he is the news&#8230;.</p>

<p>Well, the operation generally went well, went to the Bupa Little Aston Hospital at midday, and admission process completed about 1. After a bit of a lie down, i finally went into theatre about 2 and was out about 3. I finally came around about 4 though was in and out right through till 6ish when my parents picked me up. The surgeon said all went ok, though I had done some damage to the knee joint. This would probably lead to some occasional niggles. Fingers crossed these won&#8217;t stop my long distance walking ambitions. I did my physio exercises and left the hospital about 6.30.</p>

<p>After doing little yesterday evening other than watch a bit of t.v. and eat a pizza, i had an early night. I woke this morning dreading the pain as the drugs wore off. Nothing. No pain at all. Infact, to this time, the only discomfort I have felt is the stitches slightly tugging under the bandages. I have had no extra painkillers. I have been walking around a bit today, doing some exercises and even some wii tennis (but don&#8217;t tell anyone!!).</p>

<p>Looking forward to tonight&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mountain/">Mountain</a> and Bowfell and Crinkle Crags on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/listings/programme.shtml?day=today&amp;service_id=4544&amp;filename=20070812/20070812_2200_4544_24797_30">Wainwrights Walks</a>. As close as I will be getting to mountains for a couple of months me thinks.</p>
