  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had a good one yesterday or should that be a bad one? Went up to the dark peaks
to repeat one of my favorite walks from last summer - the Edale Skyline.
Basically doing the round of Winhill, Mam Tor, Rushup Edge onto Kinder edge and
down to Edale Cross. That was the plan at least until I got there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Did my first full circuit of the Church Stretton hills yesterday. Started at car
park to the north of The Lawley and walked over it. Strongest winds I have seen
here has me walking leaning 20 degrees into to to stop me blowing over. Down the
other side over fields to the base of Caer Caradoc. Climbed Little Cardoc and
then the main hill. Stopped near top in wind shade and had some lovely chicken
sandwiches&#8230; yum yum.. Post early lunch I went up Willston Hill then along
bridleway to right of Hope Bowder Hill. Through Hope Bowder and then over
Ragleth Hill brought me to the A49.</p>

<p>Crossing over into Little Stretton, I followed my favorite path up the Mynd -
Ashes Hollow. It was good fun as the steam was in full spate, and the normal 2
inch crossings turned into 1 foot crossings and all small scrambles were over
wet rock. At the top, I joined the Shropshire Way then along the open access
boundary past Jonathan&#8217;s Rock to Plush Hill. Followingi the path past Inwood
House then Oakfield, I finally joined paths over farmers fields to the car park.</p>

<p>Overall 18.25 miles with about 1150 metres of ascent. Unfortunately my legs have
never ached so much so next week I really need to calm down a bit. Mind, it will
be my first Peak District yomp of the year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was talking to my step brother Rob on Boxing Day who informed me that he was
doing the <a href="http://www.ukoutdoorpursuits.co.uk/sub-4-peaks/4-peaks-main.htm">4 peaks challenge</a>
where you walk up the highest peaks of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales (in
alphabetical order) within 48 hours. He quizzed my experience on climbing the
peaks and I was embarrassed to say I had done none of them and I am still a Munro
Virgin. A few days later whilst thinking about this, I decided to rectify it and
put some stakes down for this year. I would do the 3 peaks (missing Ireland -
sorry) spring / early summer, definitely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick walk over the Chase today with
<a href="https://twitter.com/SantTheRant">Phil Sant</a>. Signs of good weather weren&#8217;t
evident as we arrived at Glacial Stone car park - what with the rain, but at
least is wasn&#8217;t cold. We did two ~3 mile circuits firstly over Sherbrook Valley
to Rifle Range Rd then down Abraham&#8217;s Valley, Stepping Stones and through
Brocton Coppice back to car. Second circuit included Katyns Memorial and the
German War Cemetery before returning up Sherbrook Valley.</p>

<p>Good chat though maybe too much about work :( .</p>

<p>No photos today as it was pissing it down most of the time. Oh and I didn&#8217;t have
the camera.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went for another Shropshire walk yesterday. I was initially going to just walkt
over Caer Caradoc but as I reached the top I decided I would carry on over the
Lawler. After all, I was feeling fine and energetic, the weather was OK -
contrary to the forecast and I had loads of time. So off I went down over Little
Caradoc.</p>

<p>The weather held up fine as I started to climb the Lawler but deteriorated very
quickly. I was worried as it started hailing and I wondered the possibility of
the often accompanying thunder. Not a bad worry considering <a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6221167.stm">this</a>. However,
the adrenaline, and atrocious weather made me feel like a true mountaineer;
alone conquering unknown mountains far a field. This illusion was only shattered
by occasional walkers on their way down.</p>

<p>The wind was very strong blowing my poles and myself all over the place and it
didn&#8217;t get any better until I started to descend the other side.</p>

<p>It has been a while since I have done the Lawler and with the northern section
out of sight in my map case, I underestimated the time it would take to get off
the hill on the other side. Initially I worried about not being back home by
15:00 but worry increased lower down as I realised I only had till 14:00 on the
car park ticket. It was now 13:00 and I had about 3 miles to cover. 3 miles on
slippery, wet mud on a track I didn&#8217;t know and as I found out later, went up
hill!</p>

<p>Right, I was now on a mission. Not going to let car park Nazis charge me for
under payment. I even ran a bit, though Scarpa 3/4 season boots are a little
heavier and less flexible than my running shoes. Finally got to Church Stretton
at 14:30. I was relieved to get to the car and see no penalty notice under the
windscreen wiper. 1 - 0  to me ;)</p>

<p>Overall, despite the weather, I had a really good day that persisted until I hit
the M6 motorway. Damn Ikea sales coupled with heavy rain caused congestion and a
40mph speed limit :( Took 1 hour 40 minutes to the return 50 mile journey - a
record for me I think.</p>

<p>No photos, as exposing (no pun intended) the camera to the heavy rail would no
doubt knacker it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I got Orange Broadband on the 27th after a surprising cutoff from PlusNet.
I didn&#8217;t think I would be changed over till the 2nd and neither did Orange. But
I got the Live Box and a working connection after several phone-calls to Orange
Technical Support. I was a little disappointed in their support having had
conflicting statements about Apple Mac support and the accompanying cds and
manuals were all geared on XP / Wireless connections. After setting up the Live
Box though, I have been happy with the connection. 3.5Mb isn&#8217;t that fast, but it
seems to have quickened browsing a bit, and I am awaiting on an OSX update to
test it properly.  God, how sad!</p>

<p>Also, I don&#8217;t think the Live Box is unattractive, maybe odd, but it is OK. Just
await the free calls part to be activated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right, yesterday was my Birthday and as a present to myself, I decided to go for
my first proper walk since all my knee and ankle trouble. So I went back up to
the Hope Valley and repeated a  walk around Ladybower Reservoir from earlier in
the year.</p>

<p>Starting from the A57 Snake Rd by the Ladybower Inn, I walked up past Ashopton,
Winstone Lee Tor, the Wheelstones, White Tor, Salt Cellar and up to Lost Lad. I
then dropped back down to Ladybower and walked along the eastern bank to the
car. All in all, a good 7 or 8 miler. Not massive, nor great amount of ascent
but I felt nothing from my knee other than when I was walking around Hathersage
buying some clothes. My ankle was ok too and my physio has now provided  (freely
- as in beer!!) more adhesive foam to protect my outer ankle bone, good job as I
  couldn&#8217;t find them for love nor money - I am now officially loving the Scarpa
SL2s.</p>

<p>No photos today, as I tried some funky panorama stuff but forgot the spirit
level for the camera and they all came out rubbish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went out on Boxing Day to test my knee again (it worked fine ;)) and try some
slow shutter / blurred water stylee. I therefore went over the Light Spout
Hollow on the Long Mynd and took a few shots that I&#8217;ve subsequently deleted from
flickr&#8230; Only a short walk (about 4 miles) but did come down Cardingmill Valley
deliberately quickly to put stress on knee and it survived admirably - think it
might finally be on the mend!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went to physio last night, which was by far the least painful visit. This
inspired confidence to go to the Peak District or Shropshire for my first proper
walk since, er, the last one. It must have been at least a month.</p>

<p>Requirements of the walk:</p>

<p>Maximum chance of seeing a <a href="http://www.ogwen-rescue.org.uk/pictures_of_ogwen/images/main/cloud_invert.php">cloud
inversion</a>.
Fair amount of ascent with little horizontal mileage as I am unsure how my knee
will be and how  ankles are ( this is the first walk I have done in a while in
boots).  Exposure to fog to improve my micro-navigation.</p>

<p>Woke up this morning, and checked out the weather. The fog (with its cloud
inversion possibilities) and closeness of big hills to Edale was the winning
choice. So off I went.</p>

<p>Got to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edale">Edale</a> car park at 09:45 and started
walking just after 10. Crossing Grindsbrook, I met with an &#8216;older&#8217; walker and we
chatted all the way to the top of the brook. Felt embarrassed as I could just
about keep up, he was a true mountain goat hoping rocks all the way up, whereas
I was in full both handed scramble mode.</p>

<p>We were both disappointed when we reached the top of the brook as the cloud top
appeared 100 metres or more above our heads. We agreed that an inversion was
probably not going to happen and went our own ways. I started walked eastwards
along the edge and after about 20 minutes, I notices blue skies appearing. This
surely means the clouds are lowering. Quickly through the rucksack off and got
the camera out. Not much. Just seeing the top of cloud a bit above my head but
it quickly rose again.</p>

<p>10 minutes later however, the inversion happened. For about 10 minutes I could
see for miles including the top of Grindslow Knoll popping its head over the
cloud. This is my first inversion and I was amazed. The cloud rose and lowered
many times over the walk so I saw many inversions. I have also learnt that you
should try to position yourself between the sun and the inversion to see a
<a href="http://atoptics.co.uk/droplets/globrock.htm">broken spectre</a>, but that wasn&#8217;t
possible today.</p>

<p>With all this excitement, I forgot about my knee. Which must be a good sign,
because it normally reminds me by&#8230; hurting. Nothing so far. Finally after
about 1.5 mile of edge walking, I descended back to edale. During the descent, I
felt only discomfort, no pain though I did have the knee support on and used the
Lekis greatly.  Looks like my next walk on Boxing Day might happen.</p>

<p>Finally, I had to once again cross Grindsbrook and the water running over rocks
inspired me to try some creative photography, but lack of skills failed
miserably. Must learn how to use Shutter Priority mode as all my attempts were
way over exposed. Must try harder!</p>
