  <div class="entry-content"><p>Did the Malverns today with Phil Sant from work and his brother Paul. First time
I had met Paul.</p>

<p>Got to North Malvern Rd Car Park 9ish then agreed to move to next car park (at
foot of Worcester Beacon).Â  Transferred here to the Sant-mobile which took us
down to Little Malvern.</p>

<p>Went up Hangman&#8217;s Hill then British Camp before the ascent of the two biggies -
Hereforeshire Beacon and Worcester Beacon. Decent hills and a moderately visible
day though long range photos would not be possible.</p>

<p>Knee went again and the funny for the walk was Phil Sant&#8217;s boot sole falling
off. Emergency elastic band surgery failed and he resorted to carrier bag
surgery encouraging a few funny looks from passers by. Got back to the car 2ish
ready to munch a BLT, yum.</p>

<p>Got home about 3ish to buy Christmas tree. Photos uploaded soon&#8230;</p>

<p> Went out yesterday to retry the Scarpas. It must be 6 weeks or so since my
ankle started hurting and it is still bad. Went to Sutton Park, walked about 250
metres then returned to the car. Not good. Looks like a winter in approach shoes
as even my old boots hurt to wear now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Attempted a 14  miler yesterday over Cannock. I thought some distance walking
might help my knee, but it started to hurt after about 4 miles. This worries me
as it is flat land, god knows how I will survive Malvern in December. I ended up
doing about 10 miles but have recovered OK now. Can put full weight on left leg.</p>

<p>So now I might listen to the doctor and try some indoor exercises before next
walk. Oh yeah, and warm up properly.</p>

<p>Once again, I didn&#8217;t take any photos.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Was tired in the morning as we have been working hard on NHS 24 project all week
and 6.15am is no time to wake on a Sunday morning. Anyhow, I picked up Phil
8ish and started walking from Hope at 9.30.I was eager to get my first full GPS
route working but the GPS refused to pick up satellites until about  3/4 the way
up Lose Hill. Got to the top and Phil was impressed with the views of the Edale
valley. We then back-tracked back down the hill and across countryside to begin
the ascent of the larger Win Hill. The GPS proved to be convenient with only a
couple of peaks required at the map. We rushed up to the plateau and into shelter
before Win Hill Pike so that we could eat without getting drenched by the
forthcoming rain. Luckily this didnt materialise, instead we were accompanied by
slight dampness up to to the top of Win Hill Pike.</p>

<p>Good  views over Ladybower Reservoir and Stanage Edge in the distance made the
walk worthwhile. The descent brought on further knee pain though. Not enough  to
stop me walking  but enough to force poles and a slow down.</p>

<p>Best bit was probably getting back to the car  @ 2.30pm just in time for a
heavier rain shower. I love driving in the rain watching people outside getting
wet - especially the unlucky <strike>sods</strike> walkers we saw on the way
back leaving the A53 presumably on the way to Flash Youth Hostel. The rain was
heavy and I am not convinced they would get their by sunset.</p>

<p>No photosets for this walk.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t last another weekend without a walk so went over to Cannock Chase
with <a href="http://twitter.com/JewkesD">Dazmo</a> from work. Yesterday, I brought a
tripod so my excuse for going to the Chase was to try the tripod in a panoramic
style. So we started out by Milford and walked along Abraham&#8217;s Valley then
across the moorland to Sherbrook Valley. As we got there I tried the tripod for
my first panorama, which I am fairly happy with.</p>

<p>Anyhow a few more pictures latter, we complete the walk back over the stepping
stones and towards car park. This was the first walk since my  previous Scarpa
boot catastrophe and my ankle is still hurting a bit. Its also inflamed.
However, I think I will be able to do a bit longer walker next week. Maybe even
a hill!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went to court today to witness against the scumbag who vandalised my car - the
incident that started my interest in local antisocial behaviour. This is how it
went&#8230;Got to court about 9am and had to wait 1o minutes or so to get in. Just
the right amount of time to get cold and reflect on the court-case and start
worrying. Finally, got in and entered the witness room. I understood that the
defendant would be in at 10 and at this time I was disappointed by the non show
up of my neighbours - better witnesses than me having seen the whole incident
and knowing the defendant. In my mind, only the presence and willingness to
testify of all witnesses would cause the defendant to plead guilty therefore
removing my need to appear in court.</p>

<p>I was relieved when a couple of minutes later, my neighbours did show up. They
had seen the defendant downstairs, this pleased me as no shows from defendants
is supposedly quite common and would mean another day in court. We were then
introduced to both the prosecutor and investigating P.C. The prosecutor
impressed me with his informal way with us non legal types. He explained clearly
what would happen and most interestingly for me, how the cross questioning from
defence would work. This worried me as he would easily establish that I couldn&#8217;t
recognize the defendant from my brief view of his face.</p>

<p>Anyway, the intercom called for the defendant and defense  / prosecuting
solicitors  ( or lawyers, I don&#8217;t really know the difference) ; it was about to
begin. About 30 minutes passed with only a bit of conversation and police banter
taking my mind from my impending call to stand. Then the prosecutor returned
informing my neighbours and me that we were free to leave - the defendant had
done what I had hoped for days, he had pleaded guilty. Many do at the last
minute when they realise a full hand of prosecutor witnesses have turned up.</p>

<p>So there you go, my first day in court and no court case. Just got to wait a
couple of weeks now for the sentence to be announced - just about enough time
for corporal punishment to be reintroduced for antisocial behaviour offences.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s hoping&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, tonight is the night before my first court case (as a witness I hasten to
add). And since the last post, quite a bit has happened. Firstly, I have
received more letters from the council thanking me for reporting the issues last
week. Also I have made a meeting appointment for next Thursday again with the
council to discuss matters. It looks like they are seriously interested in the
problems on Park Hall.</p>

<p>Finally, I also heard back from the Police who wish me to contact them on the
weekend. Maybe they are interested too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received a reply to the email I sent yesterday to the Walsall Council
Anti-Social Behaviour Coordinator and Neighbourhood Policing department within
the Walsall Police Service. My email questioned the authorities on what was
being planned to curb the antisocial behaviour on our estate.I expected no
response for a week or so and was suprised this afternoon when I got home to see
a response from a Council representative. The response suggested that the
council would speak to the police regarding the issue and sent some forms to
print off and file in for each antisocial behaviour incident I saw. So I have
printed these and will distribute around the neighbourhood and fill in as
appropriate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its a Tuesday, and I am on holiday for the week. That means I should have been
in Wales, Shropshire or the Peak District today. But I am not. I have been
nerding at home for the longest period during the last couple of years.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that I have hurt my ankle. How? I brought some new walking
boots a couple of weeks ago and listened carefully to the guy who fitted and
sold me the new <a href="http://www.scarpa.co.uk/hill/sl.html">Scarpa SLs</a>. He told me
that the boots would need wearing in, so start of with a short walk (well
actually first two weeks in the home) and build up to decent lengths over a few
weeks. Only a fool would start out with a 15 + mile walk.</p>

<p>So off I went with the virgin boots, for a 16 miles yomp around Shropshire from
Long Mynd to the Stiperstones. Jeez, I must be tuff, feet are fine.  So a couple
of days later I went for a more sensible 8 miler around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waun_Fach">Waun
Fach</a>. Don&#8217;t know what changed but about
a mile below the summit, my outer right ankle started rubbing and hurting. I
made the summit and got down having changed socks, applied plasters etc etc but
still the ankle hurt. 10 days later and I am still unable to wear a pair of
boots without pain.  And I am now in the middle of a weeks holiday originally
destined for a few day Lakeland wonder.</p>

<p>So instead, I have created this, my first real attempt at a blog to record my
forthcoming peak bagging attempts and software development capers.</p>
