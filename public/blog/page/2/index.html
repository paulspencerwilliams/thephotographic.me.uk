  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cheryl&#8217;s mom and I have a running joke that whenever I plan a lakeland trip without Cheryl, I turn the weather sour&#8230;</p>

<p>Well, after last Sunday&#8217;s beautiful spring walk, I had my hopes up for a great solo backpack and wildcamp from Langdale.</p>

<p>I spent my lunch breaks this week constructing a stove windshield and pot cosy. I spent this morning in the garage strugging but finally succeeding in packing my stuff into my OMM 35L rucksack except for the tent, that fits great into the &#8216;Multi Sport Compressor&#8217;&#8230; Pack weight including water and food - 18lb; not bad at all.</p>

<p>Then, I spent much of this afternoon planning the route in finer detail. Done.</p>

<p>Or so I thought. About 4 o&#8217;clock, I looked at the bbc weather report to decide whether tomorrows ramble would be White Peaks or Shropshire. BBC weather said it would be fine in both places. But from the corner of my eye, I spotted snow forecast Wednesday. I had already seen a possible snow shower forest cast the usually pessimistic MWIS, but now the BBC!!</p>

<p>Further searched for weather locally, and yeah, heavy snow Tuesday night through Wednesday.</p>

<p>When I mentioned all this to Cheryl, I was about to say &#8216;I ain&#8217;t wildcamping at the top of a mountain next week, maybe I will wimp out and use a campsite&#8230;&#8217; but she interrupted suggesting that I will wimp out and use a youth hostel.</p>

<p>There is was, a seed planted. A couple of quick calls, and hopefully I will get accommodation in Buttermere and Keswick.</p>

<p>Now, all I need to do Tuesday night is replace my sleeping bag / tent in the rucksack with crampons and the ice axe!!! Oh, and fully winter gloves, hat and thermals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had a great day in Edale with Cheryl and the pre sister / brother-in-laws (coach trip quote if anyone is sad enough to watch it -no? just me..) . We tried to do a 10 miler  a couple of weeks ago, but the foot of snow put paid to that - tough walking and a possible scary descent of jacob&#8217;s ladder proved too much. So today, we set the matter straight with an attack on 1/2 of the Edale Skyline. The plan: Edale &gt; Hollins Cross &gt; Lose Hill &gt; Hope Cross &gt; Crookstone Knoll &gt; Ringing Roger &gt; Edale.</p>

<p>Now, I got a little ribbing today about my optimistic choice of shorts and a short sleeve shirt; it might be too cold and &#8216;what are those pieces of string hanging out of my shorts&#8217; (i.e. my legs&#8230;). I had my doubts about the choice early morning, mist and only 4 degrees in the car, and this remaining 1/2 way up the M1. Luckily, approaching Chesterfield, BBC weathers predictions came true, and the car&#8217;s thermometer rose to 10 degrees.</p>

<p>Arriving in Edale at about 10:30, we luckily managed to find a prime lay-by parking space only 100 metres out of the village car park. A quick change of clothes and we ascending Hollin&#8217;s Cross, and then Lose Hill. All fairly pleasent, and we enjoyed watching the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">nutters</span> fell runners competing in some kind of race. We particularly enjoyed one guy appearing to totally cut a corner, not sure whether this was allowed though he did it right in front of a marshall&#8230;The descent of Lose Hill was quick and pain free with the mandatory M&amp;S sarnies half way down. Cheers for the pork pies Steve!!!</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_174&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Edge of Kinder Scout from Crookstone Knoll&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100321-dsc_0078.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-174" title="Edge of Kinder Scout from Crookstone Knoll" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100321-dsc_0078.jpg?w=300" alt="Edge of Kinder Scout from Crookstone Knoll" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>We then started our second hill of the day skirting Win Hill, ascending the roman road to Hope Cross we got our muscles warmed up again for the hard pull up Crookstone Knoll. A few people on rock photos and Percy Pigs refueled us for the &#8216;flat&#8217; walk along the edge to Ringing Roger. Now, by this time, I was happy to see some cloud come in. Firstly, this cooled things down (see, the shorts were a good idea..) and secondly, they reduced the glare from a powerful sun and brought interest to some moody moorland photos. Played for the first time with my stronger grad filter. Maybe OTT for strength but I enjoyed a couple of photos.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_175&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Strange light over the vale of Edale from Ringing Roger&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100321-dsc_01141.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-175" title="Strange light over the vale of Edale from Ringing Roger" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100321-dsc_01141.jpg?w=300" alt="Strange light over the vale of Edale from Ringing Roger" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Finally, we descended Ringing Roger, avoided any pubs in Edale and returned to the car by about 17:00. A tough day - tougher than the nominal 10.3 miles (10.2 if it wasn&#8217;t for a &#8216;navigational occurrence&#8217; by me) with &gt; 600 metres; not bad for the peak district.</p>

<p>Even managed a Toby Carvery for dinner, turkey, yorkies and a pint of Bulmers. Nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the drive to work earlier this week, I noticed the great early morning light falling on the church in Lullington - a village I drive through. This morning, I noticed snow drops starting to appear. I often carry my camera in the car boot, so I decided to park up, get the camera out and rattle off a hundred snaps or so.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_165&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;All Saint&#039;s Church, Lullington, Derbyshire&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100311-dsc_00081.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-165" title="All Saint's Church, Lullington, Derbyshire" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100311-dsc_00081.jpg?w=300" alt="All Saint's Church, Lullington, Derbyshire" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>I have enjoyed some architectural photography recently, but I was disappointed at this mornings attempts with the church. I struggled to get far enough away to get the church in context and the pics came out a little shallow. I also failed to capture the great light, but maybe next time&#8230;. Also, the sky was perfect blue - a little bland so I will try shooting again with an interesting cloud backdrop.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_166&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;A snow drop in the church yard&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100311-dsc_00531.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-166" title="A snow drop in the church yard" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100311-dsc_00531.jpg?w=300" alt="A snow drop in the church yard" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Instead, I had a play with some flower shots and quite liked the results for the small amount of time invested. I am now getting to grips with depth of field, and in particular how I could get bokeh effects at smaller apertures than I originally thought.</p>

<p>Anyhow, an enjoyable drive to work, and was a little disappointed that on the drive home, I saw a buzzard sitting on a fence next to the road. I would have stopped to get some pictures at close range, but the road had no parking cones due to the Basra Memorial Wall opening at the National Memorial Arboretum.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had a great day with my future sister and brother in law yesterday in the Edale Valley. Got up there in decent time and arrived in Edale around 11am. Unfortunately, this is a little late on a Sunday to get a parking space. However, we were lucky enough that as we left the car park, a dog walker had just arrived back at his car. Lucky!</p>

<p>Anyway, after  a quick change of footwear and application of gaiters, we started walking up Grindsbrook and beared right towards Ringing Roger. The pull up was steep, and hard work in the strong sun, but after 30 mins we got up to the top of Ringing Roger. From here, the gradient got less but it was quite hard walking up to the edges due to the snow on steep ground. We finally neared the trig point near Ringing Roger about 12 and walked west towards Grindsbrook Clough.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_159&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Nearing the top of the edge&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100307-dsc_00021.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-159" title="Nearing the top of the edge" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100307-dsc_00021.jpg?w=300" alt="Nearing the top of the edge" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Finding the path was difficult, and we had a few moments putting feet into 2 foot deep soft snow holes,  but once the path was found, speed increased. We stopped around 1/2 way along the edge to some rocks which made an excellent place for lunch. It was now nearing 13:30 and the decision was to turn south over Grindslow Knoll, rather than continue the original plan of reaching the top of Jacob&#8217;s Ladder before descending to Edale. Time was pushing on, and we were a little concerned about how icy Jacob&#8217;s Ladder would be - it was bad a few weeks ago with far less snow on the ground. So the route was cut short a little mileage wise. Still 6 miles done - 2 or so through thick snow so the legs were worked quite hard!</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_160&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Grindslow Knoll - Last summit of the day&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100307-dsc_00251.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-160" title="Grindslow Knoll" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100307-dsc_00251.jpg?w=300" alt="Grindslow Knoll" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>A quick round of pints at the Old Nags Head Inn rounded off a great snowy and fantastically clear day. Next proper walk will be in a couple of weeks. Hopefully, the snow will have melted a little so we can up the mileage and ascent - I certainly need to as I have booked train tickets for March 31st to Windermere for a 2 night wildcamp and haven&#8217;t done more than 10 miles in the last 3 or 4 months&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, after a few months constrained really to local walks, the last couple of weeks have been great. Two weeks ago, we managed a walk over Church Stretton, and last Saturday we did Rushup Edge, Brown Knowl (easiest crossing I have ever had due to the icy peat) and descended Jacob&#8217;s Ladder.</p>

<p>This Wednesday, I decided to take the day off from work and try something a little more serious. My original idea was to try my crampons for the first time by ascending one of the snowdonia peaks, but MWIS suggested something else by virtue of heavy snow, hail and thunder. I therefore looked to other mountainous regions and decided upon attempting Whernside and Ingleborough.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_145&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Snowy Whernside&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/20100217-dsc_00011.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-145 " title="Snowy Whernside" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/20100217-dsc_00011.jpg?w=300" alt="Snowy Whernside" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>I left the house about 6am, and got upto Ingleton about 9:15 to buy the requisite OS map, having planned the route online. Finally arrived at Ribblehead about 9:45 and whilst packing my rucksack, I got chatting to a friendly local in the car park. As we discussed routes, we started walking together up the east flank of Whernside.</p>

<p>The conversation was interesting, local knowledge adds so much to these walks, I learnt about the effort on redirecting the river down Dentdale, about the shake holes, and the limestone pavements on the foot of Ingleborough. Now, I had orignally intended to finish the chat half walk up the hill, and resume normal solitary walking with my camera. However, time flew as our conversation covered the armed services, politics, and the virtues of vegetarianism (I have given up meat for lent&#8230;). Next thing I know, we are crossing an icy tarn before topping out on the summit. I was surprised to see the 6 foot or so of snow built up against the wall, and the cornice build up.</p>

<p>Once at the summit, I enjoyed an M &amp; S ploughmans sandwich and three bean / cheese wrap before resuming the walk down a decidely rocky artifical stair case. I was a little worried with the ice covered steps, and hoped the gradient wouldn&#8217;t be too much for me knee. But no, I was fine, and felt quite fresh by the time I reached the road.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_146&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Old farmhouse near Whernside summit&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/20100217-dsc_002311.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-146" title="Old farmhouse near Whernside summit" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/20100217-dsc_002311.jpg?w=300" alt="Old farmhouse near Whernside summit" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>However, time was not on my side for an ascent of the planned Ingleborough. It was about 14:30 and my walking colleage said it would take a good 3 hours to complete the second hill. This time constraint, combined with the no doubt icy north face descent  led me to the descision to walk over the limestone pavements at the foot of Ingleborought which led to a faint path over fields back to Ribbledale.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_144&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Moody limestone pavement&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/20100217-dsc_0140.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-144 " title="Moody limestone pavement" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/20100217-dsc_0140.jpg?w=300" alt="Moody limestone pavement" width="300" height="179" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>All in all, about 12 miles of walking over 6 hours, followed by an awful 3.5 hour drive down the M6. Still, a fantastic winter walking day, as the photos hopefully show&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it&#8217;s been an interesting few weeks regarding two of my three main hobbies - walking and photography. MTBing is the other one of which I haven&#8217;t done any since Christmas.</p>

<p>No, regarding walking, we have only done local walks of recent, even though we managed to get up to Keswick on my Birthday. However, whilst up there, I suffered a stomach upset so returned the very next day so no walks.</p>

<p>However, I have been putting much effort into photography, my interest being mainly driven by a new Nikon D90 given to me as a joint Birthday / Xmas pressie from the other half and my parents. Since getting the camera, I have been snapping anything and everything and my skills with the camera have come on leaps and bounds. I have spent several evenings recently re-keywording my Lightroom catalogue, and will be refining, tweaking and uploading pictures to Flickr. I am to complete the rest of my pictures by late January. Hopefully, by this time, the roads will be sufficiently clear of snow that my girlfriend will be happy to travel up to the Peak District for our first hill walk of the year.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, as some know and others don&#8217;t, I am one of those dodgy people who both walk the hills, and mountain bike. Many times I have chatted with people in both disciplines, and whilst the vast majority understand the others views and share a liking for outdoors, health etc, I have also seen examples of people with a great dislike for the others hobby. Only August this year, whilst walking up the LLamberis pass, I saw some bikes downhilling having a great time. They were traveling at a fair old pace but as they saw me and the other half, they politely slowed down, and passed on the far side of the pass. With exchanged nods, they continued down until I heard several cries emiting from a group of walkers following us up. They were about 5 in strength and wouldn&#8217;t at least give a little room for the mtbers, and instead hurled abuse at them. Now, it was about 10:30 so offiicially the bikers were in the wrong, but come on&#8230; They must have got up before the break of dawn to heave their steel beasties up the hill. Then for whatever reason, the got a little delayed and came down a little late.  But they were considerate, polite and friendly. But got nothing in return other than abuse.</p>

<p>On the other hand, i have seen many bikers riding down paths crowded with walkers, failing to slowdown and scare the walkers out of their wits.</p>

<p>So one simularity between people participating in both persuits is a subset of idiots.</p>

<p>However, whilst riding my newly converted to singlespeed mountain bike around Cannock Chase, I pondered another similarity - the getting back to basics in both mountain biking and lightweight backpacking. Part of the ethos of lightweight backpacking isn&#8217;t just buying the latest lighter version of the previous light thing. Its also about getting rid of redundant kit, using things for multiple purposes, getting rid of  a few comforts and being a little sadistic. It also lends itself to laziness - not having to carry heavy loads, not having to pack so many things - just walk, camp minimally and walk again the next day.</p>

<p>Now, I can definitely relate to the laziness part, and this in part is why I have discovered single speed mountain biking which is defined as: removing the 300+ quids worth of drivetrain related components and replace them with 1) a single rear cog, 2) a single front chainring and 3) a chain. The main advantage to this regression in functionality is to ease maintenance - no more fine tuning of gears, no more poor shifting or ghost shifts. Less to clean, and that that is left (hubs, bottom bracket shell etc) are far easier to get to. In fact, only this morning I managed to clean the bike properly without having to remove the chain. Bliss.</p>

<p>Now, unfortunately and unlike lightweight backpacking, the 2lb of weight loss brough about from removing this stuff does not translate into an easier bike to ride. I draw a parallel with lightweight stoves not being as fast or as easy to cook on that larger car tent based ones. Uphills are murder, and several downhills can&#8217;t be attacked with the normal gusto, simple because you run out of gears. However,  I still the downs as I sit back and get through them concentrating on momentus and line rather than pendalling my nuts off.</p>

<p>However, I am currently contemplating how these persuites can actually be combined. Gears, and the maintence their off have been one of the main worries about taking to the hills on multiday rides. Too many tools, and spare bits and pieces to carry. And a bike isn&#8217;t the easiest thing to carry if i need to get to a bikeshop for a new derailleur.</p>

<p>But my final similarity for this post relates to the looks from other people. I remember sitting on a train last year talking to another walker. He asked what my lakeland adventure would bring me. I told him I was expecting a 3 day walk over several mountains. He then asked where I would be overnighting. He presumed I would be hosteling etc. as I only had a 35 litre pack. In my tent I explained. But where is it? I noticed this very same confusing look yesterday when I was riding around &#8216;The Dog&#8217; in Cannock. I had got to the top of the biggest hill, and whilst my heart nearly left my chest and I thought I had left my lungs behind, when I approached two guys having a rest they were surprised that I was pushing such a big gear and struggling so much. Then they realised why - I couldn&#8217;t shift down ;(</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, phase 2 of my knee test started today.</p>

<p>Test methodology: attempt roughly half of the Edale skyline.</p>

<p>Hypothesis: my knee will work fine, no probs. Today the peaks, tomorrow the world, well several Wainwrights at least.</p>

<p>Observations: 1 nasty car crash, and early morning vista of clag covered tops,  a beautiful day with bucket loads of sun and cooling winds at just the right time. Oh and some crazy remote control kite things. V. cool.</p>

<p>Write up: started from Castleton, and today chose my scarpa sl and gaiters. Had enough of fell running shoes until spring now.</p>

<p>My route started by popping over Hollins  cross and back down to Edale. Then having had a chat with some mtbers, I started the scramble up Grindsbrook Clough. Maybe I was a little silly trying this kind of stuff, especially when I slipped on a slimy rock and ended up hugging a rock for dear life - I nearly ended up in the stream. At the top I turned left and had lunch on Crowden Tower. Nice M&amp;S ham and cheese sarnies!</p>

<p>Now, with the bad weather of recent, my heart rate started to increase as I came to my peat bog nemesis - Brown Knoll. Recollections of being thick down in methane releasing bog and the sight of three lads with peat up to their knees didn&#8217;t help, and I did think several times about chickening out and descending Jacob&#8217;s Ladder.</p>

<p>But now, the plan was set and I continued over the knoll. It wasn&#8217;t too bad up to the trig point but the ground was bad thereafter. Especially dodgy was one horizontal grough that was deceiving - normally vegetation means safe ground, but this grough had much grass yet wouldn&#8217;t take my weight. Luckily, I had been cautious and only put one foot down. As soon as I realised, the foot was out, and I retreated. I succeeded in beating the grough via a little run up and 5ft jump. Again, maybe stupid with the knee but hell, I don&#8217;t like peat.</p>

<p>Once the knoll was complete, the simple but tiring walk over Rushup edge then down the broken road to Castleton concluded a great walking day.</p>

<p>Conclusion 1: I felt no knee pain despite my rough calculations of 13.5 miles and 775 metres of ascent. I think the knee might be on it&#8217;s way to classification of fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Conclusion 2: My scarpas didn&#8217;t rub my ankle despite the physio foam donuts i normally wear in them.</p>

<p>Conclusion 3: I love getting to the car 5 minutes before a heavy downpour. It means I planned the walk perfectly ;)</p>
