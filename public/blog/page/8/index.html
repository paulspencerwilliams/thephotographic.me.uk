  <div class="entry-content"><p>Been a bit lazy with the blog updates over the last week due to other priorities - coding HDB Filestore, suffering painful broken teeth and most exciting of all&#8230;. planning my new project - <a href="http://paulswilliams.me.uk/walkingwithwilliams/?page_id=41" title="Project Wildcamp">Project Wildcamp</a> but more of that in a future post.A few things have happened with Project Peaks over the last couple of weeks. After the failure of Scafell attempt 1, we decided on the weekend around the 20th May for attempt 2. Unfortunately Chris is not available for this weekend, so current attendees will be Nick, Phil and myself. We have booked a 2 tent pitch at <a href="http://www.churchstile.com/" title="Church Stile campsite">Church Stile campsite</a>.</p>

<p>This gives us an easier (both technically and phyiscally) route up to Scafell Pike via Brown Tongue / Lingmell Coll as recommended by uk.rec.walking.</p>

<p>The camping aspect is scary / exciting at present as current weather is a bit rubbish. Still all can change in just over a week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/192/468483747_3dac0acf45_m.jpg" title="Eskdale" alt="Eskdale" align="left" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="240" />Well, Project Peaks didn&#8217;t quite get off the the start originally hoped for. I spoke with Chris on Thursday and he confirmed my thoughts; that he would not be able to make the Lakes on Friday as his cold had failed to clear. Therefore Team 1 would be Nick and myself - the dynamic duo and time was right for the attempt.We met at mine after work on Friday. We made quick progress up the M6 and got to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniston,_Cumbria" title="Coniston Wikipedia">Coniston</a> <a href="http://www.yha.org.uk/find-accommodation/the-lake-district/hostels/Coniston-Holly-How/index.aspx" title="YHA Holly How Hostel">YHA Hostel</a> about 20:30. We quickly got unpacked and made a beeline to the village centre for some food. A quick walk down the first bit of the town led to a wine bar where we made light work of Tagliatelli, wine and a Boddingtons or two. Back to the hostel about 10 gave us a chance to review the route and get an early night.</p>

<p>We awoke early and got breakfast down quickly so we could get some sarnies from Coniston for lunch and start walking early. The search for food was fruitless though and my optimism for finding lunch down Hardknott / Wrynose pass was demolishing quickly as we drove toward walk start. We therefore took a detour to Great Langdale and just as we were about to retire to Grasmere, we found a little cafe. Chicken and stuffing sandwiches, BLTs and coffees were brought but this highlighted the future need to securely source lunch before starting out. The delay meant that we didn&#8217;t start walking until 11ish - 2 hours late.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/213/468490931_661345ee85_m.jpg" title="Me in front of Scar Lathing" alt="Me in front of Scar Lathing" align="left" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="240" />We started by walking up the higher end of Eskdale towards Scar Lathing. This seemed relatively easy both physically and technically until we found ourselves a little too close the Esk near a waterfall. It was beautiful and I certainly wanted to return on our descent to play with the camera. However the drops to the right coupled with scrambling were not so good and we instead detoured around this on our descent. We continued right up-to Scar Lathing and after ascending its left flank were greeting with our first view of <a href="http://www.leaney.org/lake_district_walk_photo.php?walk_id=433&amp;photo=20020928e&amp;thumb=Y&amp;pan=Y" title="Photos of Great Moss">Great Moss</a>  - a large peat valley floor. We carried on along the Esk over this plateau for a mile or so and it wasn&#8217;t as boggy as it could have been (thank global warming for that I suppose as the Esk was low for this time of year). It still took a lot of energy to walk up the slight gradient and avoid the wet bits.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/200/468483028_e63e23665e_m.jpg" title="Nick infront of crags below Scafell Pike" alt="Nick infront of crags below Scafell Pike" align="right" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="240" />We started another ascent where the Esk separates at Little Narrowcove. We walked up the scar up to Chambers Crags and at this point we stopped. Nick had mentioned a couple of times that he was nervous of what appeared to be a ridge walk at the top of the scar - the walk between Broad Crag and Scafell Pike. This combined with our weary legs led us to the unanimous decision to turn back and descend. We were both disappointed to get so far - only another 200 metres or so were left but the sensible choice was to ensure we got back to the car in one piece.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/196/468502619_9acdd2619c_m.jpg" title="Waterfall behind Lingcove Bridge" alt="Waterfall behind Lingcove Bridge" align="left" height="179" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="240" />This proved to be the correct decision as about 1 mile into our return leg, Nick&#8217;s knee started to whinge about the rocky paths encountered today. Another 1/2 mile further and it was starting to hurt more and I did a good selling job for <a href="http://www.leki.com/html/home.asp" title="Walking poles">Leki</a> by offering him a pole. He gave it a try and it helped greatly. I was pleased that neither my knee nor ankles nor blisters has offered any pain to this point. Maybe I could complete a walk without something nearly falling off.</p>

<p>As we made the finally descent onto the Eskdale valley floor Nick noticed a sheep with a tiny lamb struggling on the floor. Nick then noticed the umbilical cord still attached to mom and that the lamb was newly born. It was very cool to watch almost the lambs first steps but I was too slow to deploy the camera for photos. We continued for another hundred yards or so to approach the first farmyard of Eskdale when my blister returned to life with a sharp pain. I applied a plaster to the inflated lump and painfully reinserted my foot in the boot.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/224/468538462_c0c0d6a4f2_m.jpg" title="First steps of a lamb" alt="First steps of a lamb" align="right" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="240" />As we continued a bit further we saw what appeared to be the sad sight of a new mother sheep with a stillborn lamb. It was motionless and the mother initially showed little interest. We turned around to walk to the farmyard to see whether any farmers were available to assist but at that moment, mother head-butted the lamb which seemed to jump start in into action. This time the camera was ready and several photos were taken included the first steps. Its amazing how such sights can act as pain relievers as I felt nothing of my blisters for a short while.</p>

<p>Another couple of hundred yards (uphill again) led us back to the car. We packed up and drove to Kendal, where, after circumnavigating the town 4 times trying to find our hostel, we enjoyed a meal at an Italian restaurant with entertainment laid on in the form of a rowing couple - I think the man was a &#8216;Love Rat&#8217;. I spent the rest of the night ensuring eye contact was not made with him after his missus left him at the table, after all, I value my non broken nose:)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to the peak district on Sunday although things were meant to be significantly different. The original plan was to do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aran_Fawddwy">Aran Fawddwy</a> in south Wales with Chris and Nick - we would do a similar distance to next weekend (Scafell Pike) with a little less ascent. However neither Chris nor Nick could make it meaning I was to do Snowdonia alone. Still, should be good&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2nd training walk happened yesterday, this time just Nick and myself as Chris was sunning himself down south at Motorcyle racing - typical as we had no sun.</p>

<p>We started early to get upto Hathersage for about 10ish. This would allow <a href="http://www.outside.co.uk/">Outside</a> (great shop!) to bash my Scarpa&#8217;s into a comfortable state before walking the ridge between Lose Hill and Rushup Edge. As the weather has been great over the last few days and I have been trying to lose weight from the rucksack, I decided to leave waterproof trousers and a fully waterproof coat at home. Instead my trusty new Paramo Fuera windproof and water resistant would keep me warm and dry (as if it would rain!).</p>

<p>As we drove up from Walsall, the weather disappointed as it was cloudy and looked like rain was a possibility. This was confirmed with a few rain drops as we entered Buxton and continued through to Hathersage. I comforted Nick by suggesting it will brighten up as the sun burnt away the moisture. We got to Hathersage in the end about 10:15 and I spent around 30 mins having the Scarpas repeatedly smacked with a hammer to try to prevent my previous ankle rubbing issues. Whilst I sweated and worried about my Â£150 boots being bashed, Nick enjoyed a cup of tea in the cafe upstairs.</p>

<p>We finally arrived at Castleton about 11.20, parked up and started walking 11.30. Starting by walking through the village, we brought some pasties and sandwiches then turned uphill towards Lose Hill. Initially the hill ascended gradually until about 50 metres before the end and the legs started to suffer. This suffering was exaggerated as the light cloud turned to mist then finally rain. My waterproof less legs were getting wet though luckily for me, Nick was windward of me and therefore got most of the rain. It was at this point that I realised the difference between waterproof and water resistent the Fuera was starting to let in a bit of water due to the constant raining even if not heavy.</p>

<p>At the summit we turned left toward Back Tor straight into the wind and rain. Nice, now the hooded face was wet. We kept our heads  down and continued at a considerable speed over Back Tor, grabbed lunch in the shade of Hollins Cross and speeded again over Mam Tor. It was disappointing that we couldn&#8217;t see anything other than mist. Only 2 after the start and we were descending our final hill of the day - well back trekking from Lords Seat on Rushup Edge. We got to the road and turned towards Castleton and the most interesting section of the walk for me. It was interesting walking along the old Chapel-en-le-Frith - Castleton Rd that finally collapsed in &#8216;77 after many rebuilds over the last 100 years. Very strange walking on what appeared a decent quality road other than the huge cracks and totally displacement of the surface.</p>

<p>We got back to the car about 3.30 expecting the &#8216;Journey From HellÂ©&#8217; being a bank holiday. Amazingly it was one of my fasted return journeys, less than 2 hours. Note to self: waterproof that Fuera.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To start the training for the Project Peaks walks (as Scafell Pike is only two weeks away) Nick, Chris, Mel and myself went over to Church Stretton for short warm up walk. Got to Church Stretton at about 11.30 at walked the direct route up to Caer Caradoc. Much chat and constant innuendos were exchanged on the ascent - good news that weren&#8217;t totally out of breath with the effort of walking! Several photos were taken which I will try to obtain for this blog.</p>

<p>From the top we turned rightÂ  down towards Winstone Hill and right again down the valley and back to Church Stretton. In all, it was a baby walk of around 5 miles with 300 metres ascent. Still a good starter and a brilliant introduction to summer walking this year - the weather was great.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not going out as last weekend I went to Wales (Hay Bluff / Lord Hereford&#8217;s Knob) and promptly knackered my ankle then my knee. This time my right knee feels how my left knee felt over Christmas. This aint good as I only have 3 weeks to mend myself before start of Project Peaks. Trying to sort physio over next couple of days and might hold back on walking next weekend too - not good as it is Easter. At least my new Paramo Fuera is GREAT.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Was a little annoyed Saturday. Normally, I manage to plan the weekends route in advance taking into account weather, what to take and similar. However, due to having to go to Scotland for a couple of days and other unpredictables, I failed to do this by Saturday morning. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned as I had planned to go out on Sunday but on review of the weather (Saturday nice, Sunday not) I decided to go out Saturday. I had&#8217;nt got a clue where I was going to go and as Church Stretton is never a mistake. I know it well enough now for poor weather to not deter me and its relatively close by.</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t done a big walk for a few weeks so I decided on a variation on the previous big walk over the south Shropshire hills. I started by parking on the north end of The Lawley.Â  I would then walk over this gradually ascending hill then down to the foot of Caer Caradoc. At the top, I would bear eastwards through Church Stretton to pick up some munchies on way to Long Mynd.</p>

<p>Carding Mill Valley was my planned ascent route and I particularly enjoyed walking past Light Spout Hollow. At the top I wondered along the plateau to descend down my favorite part of Long Mynd - Ashes Hollow. This stroll was made the more pleasant by the company of an ex vicar / church geezer. He was raving about long distance walking remenising about his own travels across south of France and Pyrenees. I haven&#8217;t seen Ashes Hollow so in spate and the scrambling was wet to say the least.</p>

<p>At the bottom I met with the A49 and turned left to tackle Ragleith Hill which wasn&#8217;t too bad. My final hill of the day was to be Hope Bowder hill, the plan being to descend and skirt Caer Caradoc and parallel the Lawley. However, I felt I had enough energy and skin on my feet to do another crossing of Caer Caradoc though I couldn&#8217;t repeat the Lawley. I finally got back to the car as it was turning dark. I blame the lack of light for the loss of my North Face beanie - oh how I miss you&#8230;</p>

<p>In the end I measured 21.5 miles with about 1250 metres of ascent and my legs felt like it until Tuesday :)</p>

<p>No photos as I couldn&#8217; t be bothered.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Damn, GTD ain&#8217;t working. Got to 11 days after my 2nd attempt at Arenig Fawr and Moel Llyfnant. I attempted this route from <a href="http://www.trailroutes.com/routes/default.asp">Trail</a> last year but retired due to a possible thunder storm approaching. I had managed Arenig Fawr but fell short of the 2nd mountain.</p>

<p>So here I go again. Got to Arenig Quarry about 08.30 but there were some dodgies in the car park opposite. As it was a v. quiet Saturday, I was a bit worried about leaving the car there so I parked it along Llyn Celyn at a National Trust car park.</p>

<p>Walked over the Afon Tryweryn and back to the quarry. Ascended a zig zag path to the base of some crags. I realised I had gone wrong on the previous attempt ended up on Y Castell. This time I also got it wrong but to a lesser degree. Crossing the marsh to the crags, I beared a little to right to take the crags nearly head on. It was a little vertical for my liking but I made it in one piece.</p>

<p>At the top of the crags, the fog came down and much compass work was needed to navigate to the drystone wall which handrailed me to the summit cairn / shelter. Its great to sit in the shade of the wind and strong rain. Decending the south west ridge was interesting with the great combination of wet rock AND wet grass AND steep decent. I went two foot sliding several times.</p>

<p>During the descent, a combination of rain and fog coupled with tired and blistering feet lead me to the solution of retiring back to the car. At the bottom of the drystone wall in the valley, I realised that the &#8216;bridleway&#8217; that took my back to the main road was not visible in the heather covered bog. The bog was quite wet and I worried about another bog / thigh encounter so I took a bearing to the start of a farmers path at the edge of the valley. I made a beeline for this having to cross several (jumpable) streams and was relieved to find the path where I wanted it.</p>

<p>I followed the path back to the road, accross the Afon Tryweryn and back to the car. Its great to get the waterproofs off and sit in the car with the heater on ;) . Also, being a Saturday I missed the Sunday driver / A5 conflict making the 90 mile journey is less than 2 hours - nice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157594575973816/">Flickr set for walk</a> ( sorry from camera phone)</p>

<p>In reflection, I made the correct choice to abandon the full trail however I was disssapointed to not be able to knock off one of my incomplete routes which currently stand at:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Arenig Fawr  /  Moel Llyfnant</li>
    <li> Cadair Idris</li>
    <li>Full Edale skyline via my hell - aka Brown Knoll</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning was early, out the house at 07:10 driving to Edale in the Peak District. The plan was to try the Edale Skyline again and I nearly succeeded.</p>

<p>Started off from the car park at about 09:00 initially up Grindesbrook Clough and then up Golden Clough. First time up there, hard work but not as technical as completing Grindesbrook. At Nether Tor at the top, the clouds had set in and visibility was down to about 70metres. Turned right along the edge and continued until Madwoman&#8217;s Stones and Crookestone Knoll.</p>

<p>Descended to Edale Cross then along approach to Win Hill before turning right down towards Lose Hill. Crossing the railway track at the bottom I started the ascent of Lose Hill. It seemed much easier that last time I did it, maybe my fitness is improving!! At top of Lose Hill, I turned left along Hollins Cross, Mam Tor then finally Rushup Edge.</p>

<p>At the end of Rushups Edge I had to decide whether to complete the skyline by crossing Brown Knoll (where I went bog snorkeling a couple of weekends earlier) or descend into the valley and reascend via Jacobs Ladder or Crowden Clough. I chose the non-option - to descend and return to the car. I wasÂ  tired and there wouldn&#8217;t have been time for the cross valley walk and re-ascent / descent.</p>

<p>In the end I completed about 17 miles with about 900 metres ascent and again failed to take any photos.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went out on Saturday for a change due to the snow. Not done any serious walking in the white stuff so was dead excited. Originally planned to do the Peaks again, attempt the Edale Skyline again, but was worried about road conditions; especially due to nearly getting stuck on Barr Beacon the night before. Instead, I went to Cannock to attempt a circuit.Left early and got to Chase Rd car park south of the Glacial Stone about 9 and promptly got stuck attempting the impossible - getting up the hill in a two wheel car. After aboutÂ  15 minutes of frantic driving including full gas reverse for about 1 minute solid, I freed the car and parked in a good position (well that&#8217;s what I thought).</p>

<p>I was suprised by the amount of snow over there. It seemed to vary from about 2 inches through 5 or 6 inches. Enough to come to top of the Scarpas. The original intention was to cover the 7 miles or so to Castle Ring then back to Stepping Stones via Rifle Range Corner. I did not factor the amount of effort walking in even this modest amount of snowÂ  would bring. After about 6 miles, I got to Severn Springs, spent 3 hours getting there and my legs were turning to jelly. Didn&#8217;t fancy walking back in the dark so abandoned the Castle Ring target and turned around.</p>

<p>On way back, I stopped at the Visitors Centre for a coffee and Apple/Cinnamon cake which gave an opportunity to reflect on walking in snow. I enjoyed it and learnt how much effort it took, and also how difficult navigation could be. Not being able to see paths, and recognize places that I know well was strange, un-comforting. It meant I had to use map and compass and even GPS for occasion grid references.</p>

<p>I got back to the car park at about 3 and noticed that the car was actually on a slight decline from the car park road. This meant reversing uphill (again) but this time, grip was absolutely absent. Spent about 5 minutes attempting to get out with no luck. Then a group of walkers passed and 4 people helped me reverse. Just a bit of weight on the bonnet was needed.</p>

<p>In the end, I did aboutÂ  12 miles with fairly negligable ascent. Took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157594528197018/">these</a> photos too.</p>
