  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once again, its been a while, no posts since May apparently. This time, there has been 2 real reasons for this:</p>

<p>1) I am lazy. I couldn&#8217;t be bothered to activate a blog spam plugin, which prevented my current 200+ comment spams per day. These made maintaining the site just undoable. However, i sorted it tonight + deleted 15000 spams!!! yah!!!</p>

<p>2) I have got myself a girlfriend, and just haven&#8217;t had the time (and I&#8217;ll admit feeling a little geeky about blogging about my walks)&#8230;.</p>

<p>Anyhow, since May, I have been walking a lot, most weekends infact, although the intensity of walks has calmed down a bit. Haven&#8217;t done many 10+ miles although I did my first wildcamp, when I walked from Windermere over High Street, camped at Angle Tarn, then walked Striding Edge to Helvelyn, then south back to Windermere. Excellent, yet totally knackering weekend.</p>

<p>Also did some of Cadair Idris a month ago or so, but came back with a stomach bug. We had camped in a quagmoir / campsite at the bottom of the mountain, and ended up having to be towed out by the farmer, as it was just TOO muddy. Have had the stomach bug for a few weeks, so failed to make my 2nd wildcamp, nor a nice couple of days for the missus&#8217; birthday.</p>

<p>Now, my mind is firmly onto the challenge of upping the walking effort, especially through the winter - I love winter!!!</p>

<p>Tomorrow night, I will be planning a simple peakland walk, probably Dovedale, with sandwiches in the cave at the end;) Then, Saturday I have a real challenge&#8230;</p>

<p>I want to do a 3 day backpack similar to what I read in last months Trail. I want to get the train upto Ravenglass, then walk or take the steam train upto to Boot / Eskdale. Then walk up Eskdale camping probably around Three Tarns. Then over to the Langdale Pikes and onto the Helvelyn Ridge the next day, probably wildcamping around Red Tarn or Grisedale. Final day will be a walk up over Highstreet and onto northern Ulswater where hopefully a bus will take me to Penrith. Not a simple walk, and need to do some training, but at least my knee seems to be ok these days!!! Big up Simon Moyes for that!!</p>

<p>Taken some nice photos recently around my old stomping grounds of Church Stretton and Peakland, but my ruddy Flickr pro account has expired. Will renew after payday and do some big uploading.</p>

<p>Right, off to the trusty OS maps&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, quite some time since I posted, mainly as I haven&#8217;t had much time. Well, in order of events:</p>

<p>Went to the Lake District a few weeks ago with Phil from work, his brother and a mate. Great time, great food, and a great amount of mostly ale. Several new experiences - first frozen tent, first time in canoe (did length of Derwent Water and back), and first real end to end walk - from Grasmere to Keswick via Greenup Edge. Best news was the walk still wasn&#8217;t enough to hurt my knee - really building up confidence in it now.</p>

<p>Also, I have done decent walks over the Peak District, and Shropshire. Last week, I did my first non Cannock Chase forest walk in the Wyre Forest. Tough day, humid and wet, but good. This weekend sees me walking probably in the Brecon Beacons or eastern Snowdonia depending on where the weather is best.</p>

<p>Next weekend is particularly exciting though, booked trained tickets for a 2 day walk and wildcamp in the Coniston / Langdale area. Not expected in Coniston until about 13:00 next Saturday, so planning an easy walk over the Old Man, then over Wrynose to camp and Three Tarns. Then a Sunday exploration of nearby Great End / Ill Crag / Scafell Pike, finally descending to Langdale, to bus back to Windermere - train out late afternoon.</p>

<p>Hopefully, normal regular posting service will resume&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As some will know, I booked a couple of days off work this week to go upto the Lake District. The purpose was some rest (yeah right), relaxation (equally not) and testing the knee by doing a bike ride, and an easy walk. After doing my back last Friday, I nearly cancelled the B&amp;B accommodation (Dunmail House - V Good). Luckily, I didn&#8217;t and my back has eased greatly.</p>

<p>Had a bit of lie in yesterday morning, with breckie at 08.30. Yum. Then a quick drive upto Keswick to 1) see whether my boots can be altered to stop the ankle rubbing, and 2) buy some gaiters. First goal failed miserably, but I did get some rather spiffy black Rab gaiters - looked good.</p>

<p>Adorned in the new gear, I left the B&amp;B proper, at about 11:00, with the intention of walking up Helm Crag and back down again. Didn&#8217;t want to push the knee too much. However, at the top, I thought I saw a path maybe a mile or so along the ridge back down to Far Easedale Gill. So off I went. A mile came and went, and nearly before I knew it, I was at the Tarn at then end of the ridge.</p>

<p>Now, this meant I had broken two rules - 1) I hadn&#8217;t told anyone of my change of route, and 2) this excursion was off the western edge of my map. Great, no map, and the worrying prospect of falling clag.</p>

<p>Luckily, I had finished the high level stuff, and easily found the path down, into the valley, and the technical though fairly easy walking continued back to Grasmere. Some lovely scenery, with my favourite (waterfalls) providing some distraction.</p>

<p>The one funny bit of the walk really was when completing the valley section - although the temperature was probably around 7 degrees, the sun was on my back. With my physical effort, I got warm, and ended up taking my Paramo Fuera off, just just had a merino base layer on. I was still too hot, but might have been arrested if I revealed my beer belly to the world!!!</p>

<p>In the end, I covered the 8 miles in about 4.5 hours, and though I was aware of my knee, it didn&#8217;t not hurt, of even register slight discomfort.</p>

<p>Was intending to ride the mtb today, but the weather was so poor that I chickened out, and came back home early. Glad I had already discounted the possibility of a wildcamp around Easedale Tarn tonight!!</p>

<p>At least, I feel like a walker again, and here are the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157604290999835/">photos</a> to prove it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Spent most of the day on the train today - had to go to london for final Knee consultation. The train had been delayed due to the freight derailment from Moor St, Birmingham. 5 hours on the train for a 5 minute consultation!! Anyhow, the consultation went well, a bit of leg twiggling and a question and answer session lead to the cunculsion that my knee is pretty much ok.</p>

<p>I need to continue my gradual exercise program, and what better way than the 2 days trip I had planned earlier to Grasmere. When I got back today, I spent 2 hours packing for Thursday&#8217;s mtb ride around Loughrigg / Langdale, and what appears to be a walk over Helm Crag on Friday.</p>

<p>The bike ride will be fairly easy, done the distance on Thursday, albeit without as much ascent, or downhill.</p>

<p>However, before yesterdays Long Mynd walk (my first serious walk in 6 mon knarlyness ths or so), I assumed I couldn&#8217;t do a proper Lakeland walk, so would probably play with the camera around some easily accessible waterfalls or similar. However, I am fairly confident now that I will be able to manage Helm Crag and maybe even over to Pavey Ark depending how I feel, and what the weather will bring.</p>

<p>The thoughts about a wild camp had been going through my mind until the recent snow and cold weather, combined with the forecast hail and thunder for Friday. I think lightening and carbon fibre poles get on a little too well!!</p>

<p>However, if I can tackle Friday&#8217;s walk, then a wild camp could certainly be on the cards when I revist the Lakes on the 12th April.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After about 8 months or so, I finally got a decent walk in today. Went over to Church Stretton with a couple of mates from work. Got over to Little Stretton by 11:00 and started walking up Ashes Hollow - my favorite route on the Mynd. Had some fun on the few rocky bits, and the water was higher than I remember so crossing was interesting&#8230;</p>

<p>However, at the top of the valley, we proceeded to Pole Bank, and swiftly turned around to North. This was where I started to get worried about the knee - it has always failed on the downhills, but as I started to proceed down Carding Mill Valley, I started to build confidence that it would be ok. Was VERY careful around Light Hollow Spout, but picked up speed right down into Church Stretton. After a quick break, we continued along Ludlow Rd back to the car. So 8 rocky miles, great fun, and a happy reintroduction to walking.</p>

<p>Not only did I enjoy today, but it also provided valuable feedback for tomorrows final consultation on the knee, and also filled me with confidence for the impending Lake District visit Wednesday night. Plan currently is a ride around Rydal on Thursday, then maybe a visit to Helm Crag on Friday before either camping or driving back. However, seeing the thunder / hail combination forecast for Friday, I think I will be driving back!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since my 2nd arthroscopy 6 weeks ago, I have been raring at the bit to 1) get out, into the hills, 2) get some exercise and 3) have some fun on the bike.</p>

<p>Tonight, I scored 2 out of 3 - a breathless blast on the bike around Cannock Chase. It was good to get out, they have improved the trail having added a couple of sections since my last ride. I only did one lap at about 7 miles, and had a sharp pain in knee about 1/3 of the way around, but it only lasted about 2 seconds. After that, the knee was fine.</p>

<p>Just as well, as I am going up to Grasmere for my first 2008 lake district excursion on the 27th / 28th and it won&#8217;t be much fun stuck in the B&amp;B.</p>

<p>Might do my first walk for 6 months or so also, on Good Friday or Easter Monday. A couple of people from work might be up for a short-ish Midlands wonder. Think I might push for Caer Caradoc, been well over year since I have visited it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since last summer, most of my posts have been about my knee, and my reacquaintance with mountain biking. This are linked, as I have been restricted to biking since my knee problems of last year. Well, light at the end of the tunnel appears blurry, but visible having gone through my second arthroscopy yesterday. The previous op was a failure allowing at mot 3 miles easy walking before pain prevented further progress.</p>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s post-op consultancy filled me with confidence. The 2nd opinion disproved further cartilage problems and the pain seems to come from gristly sinew stuck between the load bearing knee surfaces. This was easily cleaned out, and the prognosis is a return to walking in 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Its funny, I can track my confidence in returning to the hills by the interest shown in Trail and TGO magazines. Since taking out the last subscription in May, I have only skim read them, but last night in my morphine fueled frenzy, i cover to covered the March Trail edition. Going to get the Laser Comp out next week for an airing. Who knows, maybe an Easter return to the countryside even if I will be keeping the miles to a minimum. Going to scan the Explorers tonight for some easily accessible wild-camping spots&#8230;..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another month passes and another month without any hill walks. Infact since June all hill entertainment has been on two wheels rather than two feet. Anyhows, went to see another orthopedic surgeon yesterday, this time in London. After an MRI scan, and some manipulation of the knee / lower leg, he has suggested another arthroscopy to understand the root cause of my knee pain. He said my cartilage wasn&#8217;t &#8216;perfect&#8217; and some further trimming could be necessary.</p>

<p>It really is so frustrating having missed the winter walking. However, hopefully I might be back on the hills in March or April. In fact, I am going to book a weekend in Keswick for mid April so hopefully at least a wonder to the foot of Catbells&#8230;. Will have to make the most of the pre-op rides around Cannock and and a probably Peak District excursion on the 26th of Jan - Yeah!!!</p>

<p>Then, hopefully, full service will be restored ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, as some have noticed, there hasn&#8217;t been much walking news on this site, due solely to my knee problems. Well, to keep people up to date, I went for my &#8216;final&#8217; consultation yesterday which I hoped would explain why, 4 months post op, I still can&#8217;t walk more than 2 miles without knee pain. It didn&#8217;t with a &#8216;wait another 3 months&#8217; and little more explanation.</p>

<p>Disappointedly, I resigned to maybe another year of no serious walking, but it motivated me to finally speak to another consultant in London. His secretary discussed my problem and was surprised the original consultant had not organised an MRI scan, especially due to my longer than expected recovery.</p>

<p>I have therefore requested my medical notes to forward on, and will hopefully make an appointment in the week before Christmas to hopefully get a 2nd opinion. That, and the latest TGO article on waterfalls in the Lakes is spurring me on to walking 2008.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t wait!!!!</p>
