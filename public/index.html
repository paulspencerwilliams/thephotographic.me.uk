  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, over a year has passed since I last posted. Don&#8217;t worry, I have still been walking, although not as much in the hills as in the past. However I have been riding my mountain bike a lot. This has increased even more so over the last couple of months as a couple of mates and I train for our first <a title="Welsh Ride Thing" href="http://welshridething.blogspot.com/">Welsh Ride Thing</a> attempt in June.</p>

<p>Well, yesterday, I broke the 20 mile ride for the first time this year. I followed the Hope Tour route from the Vertebrate Graphics White Peak book. 22 miles, and &gt; 1000 metres to climb was the target, and my singlespeed Orange P7 the weapon.</p>

<p><a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/photo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-325" title="Mam Tor ridge from Hope Cross" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/photo.jpg" alt="Mam Tor ridge from Hope Cross" width="500" height="292" /></a></p>

<p>I was out of the house early so I could start riding around 9am, leaving the main car park at Hope, Derbyshire. The weather was beautiful, though slightly cold - this would be perfect for the drag up past Win Hill to Hope Cross. Riding at my own pace, it actually went quiet well and whilst I did get off and push for the steeper sections, my 20 tooth rear cog allowed me to ride most of the climb.</p>

<p>Over the top, and there&#8217;s my favourite descent of the Peak District down to Rowlee Farm. Rocky descents where momentum is your friend is one area where the low ratio gear caused problems. I could not maintain the speed I&#8217;d have liked to, and thus my legs and arms got more of a pounding than if I could have pedalled through it. I had to stop a couple of times just to give my limbs a rest!!</p>

<p>Over the A57, and I actually managed to clean the climb out of Rowlee Farm and was delighted to get the top for the descent past Lockerbrook Farm to the reservoirs. I managed to ride past Fairholmes without stopped for a pastie and was soon climbing (well pushing) up the steep bridleway back up towards the crossroad above Hagg Farm. I met a great couple half way up that I actually rode with for most of the remaining miles. The drop to Hagg Farm is another classic, I really love my P7, and am so glad I recently sorted the seat post out&#8230;</p>

<p>Over the A57, and after another short downhill blast comes the pain. A long slog along the reservoirs, then up and over the flanks of Win Hill takes you to Thornhill and my riding nemesis - Aston. I hate Aston. Yes it&#8217;s a pretty little hamlet and beautiful surroundings. But it&#8217;s always the signal for a painful drag up Win Hill, and this was the 3rd time my bike was pointing towards the sky on Win Hill today. This last climb took me within 300 yards of Hope Cross, and after 18 miles or so, it wasn&#8217;t a great warm down. At least at the top, you get the chance to point the bike back down the hill down the slightly rocky though disappointing straight downhill back into Hope.</p>

<p>As I rode back toward town, I stopped suddenly to help a Duke of Edinburgh student who had collapsed. She was been looked after by local walker but unsure whether they could get an accurate call through to the emergency services, I rode into Hope and reported the incident from 18 Bikes.</p>

<p>I finally managed to reaquiant myself with the car about 3pm. 5 and a half hours I&#8217;d spent in the saddle, and boy, does my back end know about it!! In fact, when home in evening, I started researching Sudocream and chamois creams - I&#8217;m not looking forward to the 3 day event in Wales anymore!!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while. A while since I&#8217;ve blogged about walking that is. And well, it&#8217;s mainly because it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve hill walked. I&#8217;ve been doing lot&#8217;s of local walks recently, but yesterday was my first hill of the year.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;B &amp; W Gate near the top of the wood above Fairholmes&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/5441625599/"><img title="B &amp; W Gate near the top of the wood above Fairholmes" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5019/5441625599_8262ac14ab.jpg" alt="B &amp; W Gate near the top of the wood above Fairholmes" width="500" height="333" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;159&#8221; caption=&#8221;Wood near Derwent Reservoir&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/5441590653/"><img title="Wood near Derwent Reservoir" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5441590653_5c20bdf07a_m.jpg" alt="Wood near Derwent Reservoir" width="159" height="240" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>The plan this year is for a decent Peak District or similar walk every other week, and yesterday Cheryl and I walked from the Fairholmes car park on the edge of the Derwent Reservoir up to Alport Castles - my first time to the Castles and my first time walking up this side of the reservoir. It was a really pleasant day. Yeah, it rained at the stop, and just after lunch, but it wasn&#8217;t too warm or cold, and the varying weather made for great photos. Being our first hill walk for a while, we deliberately kept the miles low but were fine at the end.</p>

<p>The highlight of the day for me was seeing the water fall over both dams on the reservoir. The sound was impressive, and I was hoping to try some slow shutter speed photography, but I had forgotten my ND filters and there was just too much light for this. The walk along the eastern shores was much more interesting than the other side, with lots of interest; waterfalls, still ponds and old village ruins. We agreed that we must revisit in April to see the rhododendrons blossom.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;500&#8221; caption=&#8221;Sun behind cloud&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/5441624371/"><img title="Sun behind cloud" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5251/5441624371_1dfc63e7fc.jpg" alt="Sun behind cloud" width="500" height="332" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>The walk up from the reservoir to the castles wasn&#8217;t too bad, and we enjoyed sandwiches on the edge, looking over the next valley. Even spotted some wildcampers in the valley below, though at midday, this was a little late to strike pitch!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve <a title="Alport Castles from Fairholmes Flickr set" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/sets/72157625914429359/">uploaded some photos</a> from the day, and promise to both hill walk, and update this site more frequently. I promise!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Decided on a bike ride in the Peak District for Saturday. A quick scan through my <a title="White Peak Mountain Biking" href="http://www.v-publishing.co.uk/titles/index/white-peak-mountain-biking-the-pure-trails.html">White Peaks book</a> led to a planned Cromford Circuit ride - about 21k. As I was on my own for the day, and in such a beautiful place, I decidied to get up their early and have a play with the camera over at Black Rocks which was good.</div>

<p>My last <a title="Yorkshire bound for Booze and Crackpot" href="http://walkingwithwilliams.me.uk/2010/10/22/yorkshire-bound/">post</a> on Friday suggested that Chris and I rode at least the <a title="Booze and Crackpot round, Swaledale" href="http://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/mtb-home/mtb-findaroute/mtb-route-boozecrackpot.htm">Crackpot</a> loop from the <a title="Dales Bike Centre" href="http://www.dalesbikecentre.co.uk/">Dales Bike Centre</a> on Saturday. Well, about 10 minutes after I posted, Chris arrived at my home, we swiftly transfered his stuff to my car and off with shot. Well, for about 20 minutes until we hit traffic at Nottingham, Mansfield, Chesterfield, Sheffield, you get the picture. Things weren&#8217;t looking good for early arrival and pub meal up in Grinton. However, after passing Sheffield, suddely the traffic dispersed and we motored on through the Dales.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here we go, first natural mountain bike ride for a couple of months. Been talking about a weekender with Chris, an ex colleage and fellow mtber for a while. Snowdonia was a comman theme, but in the end, Chris suggested a circuit of Swaledale, Yorkshire as detailed in a magazine. He also mentioned the <a title="The Dales Bike Centre" href="http://www.dalesbikecentre.co.uk/">Dales Bike Centre</a> at Grinton as the obvious place to stay. So with about 2 seconds of thought, we booked up for this weekend.</p>

<p>I have been trying to train for this circuit, as my bike is currently in singlespeed mode; not ideal for any Dales ride, and the Peak District <a title="Hope Triple 8" href="http://www.mountainbikerides.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=1:the-peak-district&amp;id=14:hope-triple-eight&amp;Itemid=2">Hope Triple 8</a> circuit was a great start.  Similar gradients, abeit smaller hills were a challenge, but I did clean 2 of the 6, and rode significant portions of another 2. However, since then, I have suffered a little with the knee, but after some physio and Cannock Follow the Dog / Monkey Trail laps, I think I am just about ready.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks, a little further planning has been done. After the Dales Bike Centre suggested few singlespeed compatible circuits, we have decided on the southern loop of the <a title="Booze and Crackpot Round of Swaledale" href="http://www.mtbthedales.org.uk/mtb-home/mtb-findaroute/mtb-route-boozecrackpot.htm">Booze and Crackpot</a> round of Swaledale, possibly extending to the northern loop if legs, backs and cake supplies allow.  Of particular interest to me will be my recent conversion to flat pedals; hopefully a little caution and my 661 pads will get me down in one piece&#8230;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll be leaving the Midlands this evening, and hopefully dining at the Bridge Inn, Grinton this evening. Returning Sunday afternoon, with the non biking gaps filled with some photography, and beer drinking - well, we do have to rehydrate!!</p>

<p>Pics and report to follow&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, here&#8217;s a post about photography but with no photos&#8230; I am currently thinking about how to organise my Flickr account to acheive two goals:</p>

<p>1) To support my blog&#8217;s stories about hill walking, wildcamping etc.</p>

<p>2) To showcase my hopefully improving photographic skills.</p>

<p>The problem is that often, these goals are at odds&#8230;.</p>

<p>To fulfil a showcase, I should only publish photos that I believe to be both technically good, and also aesthetically pleasing. The problem with this is that for example, during my recent weekend in Snowdonia, only 5 or six photos taken met these characteristics.</p>

<p>Now, on the other hand, to support my hill walking posts, I often want to upload most photos from a day. Even if I don&#8217;t embed the photos in a post, I would probably be best to link to a Flickr collection at the bottom of the post. Now, many of these photos are only snaps, sometimes only from the iPhone, in the midday sun with little thought to photography.</p>

<p>Oh hum, maybe another glass of wine and a sleep will shed some light on this problem&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, what a wonderful weekend. Sun didn&#8217;t stop shining and worst weather related problem was the air conditioning failing on my car when driving to Snowdonia - must get it recharged. Anyhow, plan for the weekend was to scoot over to Caernarfon Friday afternoon and have a go at Snowdon Saturday.</p>

<p>It would be rude to drive through Betws-y-Coed without doing a little outdoors shopping, and I surprised myself by only coming away with a Mountain Hardware shirt. The drive then across the A5 cheered us up - only a little snow was left on Snowdon so all looked good for Saturday. We rounded the day off with a pleasant meal in Caernarfon and an early night.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;199&#8221; caption=&#8221;Yachts in Doc Fictoria, Caernarfon&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/4515792196/in/set-72157623716328093/"><img class=" " title="Yachts in Doc Fictoria, Caernarfon" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2775/4515792196_5137c88402.jpg" alt="Yachts in Doc Fictoria, Caernarfon" width="199" height="300" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Saturday morning, we fueled up at Macdonalds, then drove over to Llamberis parking right at the foot of Snowdon. Think we got the last spot in the car park. Then was started the walk. It was real hot, and I always struggle in the heat. Sure enough, by the half way house, I was pleased with my choice of shorts and short sleeved t-shirt given the mocking I had all morning.</p>

<p>A quick stop at the Halfway House for more water, and we continued to climb eventually reaching snow level at the higher tunnel under the railway. The snow was easily overcome, or sidestepped; I wish I had tried my fell running shoes for the first time this year. Before we summited, we found amusement at how people were tackling the icy shoot between the plateau and the top of the Pyg Track - mainly on their bottoms.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;People slidding down to descend Pyg Track / Miner&#039;s Path&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goatifiedcreature/4515176089/in/set-72157623716328093/"><img class=" " title="People slidding down to descend Pyg Track / Miner's Path" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2761/4515176089_c7a312f7f7.jpg" alt="People slidding down to descend Pyg Track / Miner's Path" width="300" height="200" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>We summited about 13:00 and dropped over the other side of the hill towards the Snowdon Rangers path to find some tranquility to enjoy lunch. It really did feel like summer, even at the top.</p>

<p>We then returned over the summit, but as we dropped past the new building, we saw a search and rescue helicopter hovering above Crib Goch. We feared the worst, but speculated that it would be OK - the helicopter seemed to be right over the ridge rather than to a side - and thus a fall. Unfortunately, Sunday morning we learned that a guy had a suspected heart attack - our sympathies go out to his family and friends. A little subdued, we continued the descent which went pretty quickly and uneventfully.</p>

<p>On arrival at Llamberis, we quickly dispatched ice creams and drove back to Caernarfon for a MASSIVE chinese banquet. I am sure we undid all the good work done, but it was worth it.</p>

<p>Sunday morning saw a more leisurely walk along the Afon Llugwy to Swallow Falls from Betws-y-Coed. I must be getting better as I entered Cotswold Outdoors and I didn&#8217;t even buy anything!!! The weekend was rounded off with burger and chips at a pub in the village. All in all, a great weekend though we must surely pay for the great weather with some rain&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of months ago, I booked train tickets to Windermere for my first wildcamp of 2010. Initial plans were to hostel at Windermere Wednesday night, then bus to Langdale, walk to and camp on Haystacks, then Dale Head and finally end up in Keswick for the bus back to windermere Saturday morning. However, due to the forecast snow and gales, I chickened out of camping, and instead chose to hostel at Buttermere.</p>

<p>Thus, after an excellent journey and sleep Wednesday, I found myself Thursday morning bussing to Buttermere Youth Hostel. This journey was an experience. Started with heavy snow on Dunmail Raise, just missing photographing an extremely low flying plane over Thirlmere, and confirmation of the amount of snow lying on the hills. Then, the next bus journey saw us put a BMW into a fence near Catbells, and a slippy ascent of Honister Pass.</p>

<p>Anyhow, finally, Thursday lunchtime I decided the afternoon wouldn&#8217;t give enough time for an ascent on Haystacks, especially as I hadn&#8217;t got an up to date weather forecast, so instead, I took a walk around Buttermere lake. I did spice up the low level walk with some scrambling up the two waterfalls at base of Red Pike and High Crag - all in the name of photography ;) Thursday evening saw a lively chat with a youth hostel room mate, a beef burger and a few beers and double Jura single malts.</p>

<p>Friday morning, and I was up early. After breakfast, I walked along the SE shore of Buttermere to the bottom of Haystacks, and started climbing towards Scarth Gap. Nearing the top, I had to choose whether to go all out along High Crag towards Red Pike or be sensible and just bite of Haystacks. I choose the latter, mainly as snow and low visibility was forecast for around 14:00.</p>

<p>The ascent of Haystacks was ok; the large rock steps were covered by fresh snow which gave good enough grip although a few sections did look tricky for the descent. Infact, following the main path over the cairns was difficult when entering the rocky sections. Several down climbs on icy steps nearly forced a rethink and retreat, but no, I scrambled down and evently reached Innominate Tarn about 11:00.</p>

<p>The scenery was fantastic, the snowy Gables and Pillar dominating the vista with the tarns providing perfect subjects for photography. I wanted to get the tripod out, and play with filters etc. However, a huge black cloud was incoming from Borrowdale, and I feared this might bring snow, a white-out or general hill fog, so I continued with some hand held shots and thus allowed me to descend shortly after.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_189&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;A tarn on Haystacks&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/20100402-dsc_00931.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-189" title="A tarn on Haystacks" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/20100402-dsc_00931.jpg?w=300" alt="A tarn on Haystacks" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>It was on descending the rocky summit of Haystacks that my heavy rucksack (the DSLR, tripod, crampons, axe and winter clothing a light sack does not make) gave me the biggest problems. My centre of gravity was way off, the the rucksack did it&#8217;s best to pull me of the slippy but sure handholds when scrambling down the icy steps. Also, my Scarpa SLs providing great problems in keeping traction in compacted snow, I definately seemed to slip more frequently than others around.</p>

<p>Upon descending to Scarth Gap, I took a left to a rocky outcrop that provided a perfect view to upper and lower Ennerdale. The High Level Route on Pillar stuck out in the snow so clearly, and it was supprising how much more snow was on the valley floor than in the neighbouring Buttermere.A re-ascent of Scarth Gap and uneventful descent back to Buttermere followed.</p>

<p>Last time I walked down this hill, I nearly cried with pain due to my knee, and I waited and waited for a reshow. But now, the knee was ok, even with the weight I was carrying. Infact, the only thing I really noticed was my lack of hill fitness - infact the largest hill I have done in 2010 was a leisurely paced Whernside.</p>

<p>However, peak bagging will soon pick up. April will bring Snowdon twice. Then Scafell Pike, Nevis and two other Munros are the aim of May&#8217;s Scotland holiday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it had to happen someday. A visit to the Peak District without the aim of climbing a hill. We had planned all week to visit the Peaks with Nick from work. Also, having done a fair amount of ascent recently, Cheryl also suggested a longer but flattish walk. So a quick visit to <a title="Walking Britain website" href="http://www.walkingbritain.co.uk/">Walking Britain</a> and a walk from Monyash to Lathkill Dale was chosen.</p>

<p>Nick picked us up about 10ish, so we walked out of Monyash about 11. The first couple of miles were incident free, other than some piss taking out of my shorts - their 2nd outing this year! I must admit I was a little chilly&#8230;</p>

<p>Things went slightly amis however, when we descended into Caves Dale. We should have climbed straight out of it again to head over to Youlgreave, but alas, I wasn&#8217;t concentrating on the map, and thus beared left into Lathkill Dale. This valley should have been the return leg, but instead we choose to walk down it.</p>

<p>Its a great valley, smaller and less dramatic than Dove Dale, but it did feel more remote, and dare I say, more pretty. There was green moss growing on just about every wall and tree. There were beautiful waterfalls (some man made) so I bored my companions a little by rattling off about 300 photos. Oops!</p>

<p>Then, we continued further downstream to a point where the valley opened up. We sat, eat lunch and watched ducks fight and dive in the river. A little further down the stream on Conksbury Bridge, I saw my first live trout - there were loads of them.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_183&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;300&#8221; caption=&#8221;Trout in the River Lathkill&#8221;]<a href="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100328-dsc_0199.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-183" title="20100328-DSC_0199" src="http://walkingwithwilliams.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/20100328-dsc_0199.jpg?w=300" alt="Trout in the River Lathkill" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>After some consideration at the bridge, we decided to take the shorter option back to Monyash by simple retracing our steps through Lathkill Dale right to the end. So we did, and a very pleasent walk back it was. It&#8217;s amazing how different the views are looking through a valley one direction and the other. Then, once we entered the section above Caves Dale, the terrain got a little tougher, and it became more obvious were were in limestone country. Lots of caves, and limestone crags providing quite dramatic views. This upper section takes you to within a mile of Monyash, so after some simple trekking over a couple of farmer&#8217;s fields, we arrived in Monyash about 17:00. We found a cafe on the way back to the car and polished off toffee and chocolate ripple ice creams - the first outdoors ice creams of the year.</p>

<p id="__mce"><br /></p>


<p>All in all, a great walk and the weather was ok. Unfortunately, as blogged yesterday, snow is forecast for my lakeland expedition but at least my YHA bookings are now confirmed at Windermere, Buttermere and Keswick. Just got to plan the route between them!!</p>
