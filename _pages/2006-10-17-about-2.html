This blog was originally intended for me to document countryside / hilly rambles so that I could recall outings and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_bagging" title="peak bagging">peak bagging</a> antics. However, it will also provide an outlet for my musings and a sandbox on which to stand when I get pissed with things.

About me? Well, I am a (er how am I going to categorise myself ...) Birmingham  (England!!) based software developer mainly interested in hill/mountain walking, music (Drum and Bass, hip hop, house predominately) and software development.
